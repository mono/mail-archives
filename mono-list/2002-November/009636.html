</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This would allow you to transform your binaries into a form that would

</I>&gt;<i> source-code level transformation, because it handles the many source
</I>&gt;<i> languages that compile to both bytecode formats (C#, VB, Haskell; Java,
</I>&gt;<i> Jpython, AspectJ), and because source code can be compiled then fed into
</I>&gt;<i> such a tool. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My understanding is that Java bytecode -&gt; CIL would be much more
</I>&gt;<i> feasible than the reverse. Roughly, CIL has a superset of Java
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities. CIL has delegates (for which Java has no analog [anon-

</I>&gt;<i> planned for .Net future versions is more powerful than that planned for
</I>&gt;<i> future Java.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMO the bytecode transformation process would not be particularly
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to implement. MS have done it for their JUMP and Visual J#
</I>&gt;<i> products.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, we hit the afore-mentioned obstacle of the Java (or .Net)
</I>&gt;<i> libraries. Most code will be riddled with calls to standard APIs that
</I>&gt;<i> will not exist in the target platform. (Because this is a deep, complex
</I>&gt;<i> and undecided issue, I wont go further here, but refer the reader to
</I>&gt;<i> other posts in the &quot;Mono/Java interop&quot; thread.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that such a bytecode converter might be used on-the-fly like a JIT
</I>&gt;<i> if it was sufficient fast.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Transform Java bytecode to CIL, or the reverse
</I>
	Far too complex: We'd have to duplicate the huge amount of 
libraries written for Java. Would be kind of useless if the generated code 
doesn't hit Sun's compatibility tests. If I see how far VMs like caffee 
are today... If I see that even huge vendors like Oracle are stick with 
their Java forks on version 1.1.x.... Dunno if this is worth the effort. 
Think such a thing always would be in the state of a useless (since 
incomplete) geek toy.


&gt;<i> 2. Transform Java source code into C# (possibly the reverse)
</I>&gt;<i> If a developer has some Java or C# source that they wish to use in a
</I>&gt;<i> foreign system long-term, they will want to convert the source code to
</I>&gt;<i> maintain it. Having a binary only converter (1) is not sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Such a tool would be less flexible than (1), probably operating on
</I>&gt;<i> C#&lt;-&gt;Java only. It is a definite second priority IMO to bytecode
</I>&gt;<i> conversion. It may encounter similar difficulties to (1) regarding
</I>&gt;<i> conversion of C# -&gt; Java (lack of delegates, attributes, etc), and
</I>&gt;<i> platform API support, but is otherwise quite feasible. MS have an
</I>&gt;<i> implementation in JUMP.
</I>
	Yes, here could be some use for. Specially if people want to 
switch from Java to .NET. As Miguel pointed out having such a tool also 
could help stabilizing Mono since such a tool could offer a way to quickly 
generate huge amounts of code to feed Mono with.

&gt;<i> 3. Call into foreign binaries (eg libraries) locally from within a VM
</I>&gt;<i> process
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Theoretically, I think JNI allows this to be done, but I see many
</I>&gt;<i> practical difficulties, including passing/returning objects types
</I>&gt;<i> between CLR and JVM, and garbage collection between 2 systems, and
</I>&gt;<i> controlling JVM lifecycle (eg shutdown at least).
</I>
	Have implemented such a thing over the weekend. It's named JNI#,
available from <A HREF="http://taschenorakel.de/mathias/toys.info.">http://taschenorakel.de/mathias/toys.info.</A> As the name
implies it's built as PInvoke wrapper arround the JNI API. Additionally
I've started to hack some convinience wrappers arround the JNI API.

	As you pointed out: Main problems to work out are two conflicting 
garbage collectors and shutdown of the JVM.



Ciao,
Mathias
