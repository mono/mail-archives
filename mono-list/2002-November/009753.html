<PRE>Jonah,

It's good to hear that there is someone out there looking for the
SybaseClient functionality that I have been working on.  There's
good news and bad news in this department.

The good news is that work was started on the SybaseClient provider.
The bad news is that it isn't done yet. :-)

The current status of this is &quot;unknown&quot;.  In the next day or two,
I'm going to ask Miguel to move some files around for me in CVS.
This will remedy the current situation, which is that the
Mono.Data.SybaseClient, Mono.Data.TdsClient, and System.Data 
assemblies will not coexist nicely on Linux.

Once I am able to build these assemblies on Linux, then I will
be able to go through them and get things working.  I'm not sure
how long it will take, but it's probably not that much work.  All
of the internals are mostly implemented; it's just a matter of
tweaking the provider API.

As far as I know, the only feature of TDS 5.0 used by Sybase
that I do not currently support is the use of prepared statements.
This will be fairly easy to implement.  Most of TDS 5.0 is
the same as TDS 4.2, which works for the most part.

So, the short answer is: no, it is not supported yet, but it
will be soon.  If you are intending to use this in a production
environment, however, I suggest that you hold off on that for
a while yet.  It's good to play with, but I wouldn't trust it
that much.


&gt;<i> Tim,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I sent this to Rodrigo before I realized that you were the man on
</I>&gt;<i> Mono.Data.TdsClient (for Sybase). I'm having a hell of a time and was
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if you had any info on the availability of the Sybase .net
</I>&gt;<i> provider???
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance,
</I>&gt;<i> Jonah

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Rodrigo,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm searching high and low for a .net provider for Sybase. It's hell!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've got the ODBC.NET provider running against Sybase System 11 driver and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it works but it's waaay slow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've tried several other options but nothing seems to work. I'm curious if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your Mono.Data.SybaseClient provider is available/freely distributed???
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If not, any info you can give me on setting up an ADO.NET connection into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sybase would be totally appreciated. I just can't believe there's no good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sybase provider for .net out there! Hope to hear from you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Jonah
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
