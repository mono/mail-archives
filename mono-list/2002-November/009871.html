<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I am an ASP.Net developer and would like to test my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> applications on mono. 
</I>
&gt;<i> You definitely want to wait for us to get another release 
</I>&gt;<i> out, and iron out the little problems.
</I>
I'm another ASP.NET developer with loads of Linux experience and
absolutely no fear of getting my hands dirty to make work whatever you
currently have available.  Can you give me a starting point?  I've
already installed the &quot;Mono for Debian&quot; package from debianplanet.org on
my Sid system and have been building C# libraries and executable
assemblies...  I have no idea how to start the ASP.NET-capable web
server, though.

&gt;<i> As for your help, it will be very welcomed.  We need 
</I>&gt;<i> people who can submit good bug reports, and investigate 
</I>&gt;<i> the sources of the problem, so the developers can be 
</I>&gt;<i> more productive.
</I>
I'm all over it, just tell me how to get started.  I'll switch to the
CVS code if that's preferred.  I'm currently building custom ASP.NET web
controls for a living, so I have plenty of stuff to port over and try on
Mono.

&gt;<i> Documentation, tests, regression tests, documentation, 
</I>&gt;<i> bug reports, documentation are some examples of things 
</I>&gt;<i> you can do.
</I>
Outside of the class libraries, is there a standard format for Mono
documentation?  I can produce whatever format you need including Monodoc
XML if that's appropriate.  I'd love to write some HOWTO stuff for
getting started with custom control development under Mono and perhaps
other ASP.NET topics.

-Zak
