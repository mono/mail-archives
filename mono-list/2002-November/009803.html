I used to do mono development on a k6 400.
Most of the benchmarks in mono are as fast as gcc up to about 50%
slower. There are a few cases where gcc can optimize code a lot better,
but usual application code is just about 0-10% slower with mono.
So, it's up to you to decide if using a language like C# and a CLR
runtime with support for GC, safety etc. is worth the slight slowdown.
We're working on a new jit that will reduce the performance gap even
further and we still need to do profiling runs to optimize the runtime
(expect that to happen as we drive the release process to mono 1.0
in the second quarter next year).
