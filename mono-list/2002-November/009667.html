	Sure - I don't disagree that sampling is a good method; I just don't
think requiring the OProfile kernel module is a good way to set about
implementing optimisation for a user-land process in fact I'm convinced
it's a daft idea. Combined with that, the fact that you have to treat
different processors differently ;-) [ AMD vs. Intel ] even within the
x86 family - and that the counter stuff doesn't work on older machines -
I think it's not a good plan.

&gt;<i> Instrumentation, however, is always on, or atleast

</I>
	Sure; and hard to put in place.

&gt;<i> OProfile does most everything we want to do.  It is an
</I>&gt;<i> existing piece of code that is able to leverage
</I>&gt;<i> hardware mechanisms for collecting profile data (and
</I>&gt;<i> does so at very low overhead).  Yes, OProfile is
</I>&gt;<i> probably overkill for this problem, but its facilities
</I>&gt;<i> can be scaled down for what we need it to do.
</I>
	If you just hack out the RTC sampling stuff from OProfile, you'd be
allright perhaps; but then you might as well write it yourself. Also, I
believe that one reason for OProfile's speed is that it does no
interpretation of the PC data, just logs it raw - that being done later,
so ...

&gt;<i> The high-speed timer is an idea I'd be willing to
</I>&gt;<i> consider as an alternative to OProfile.  If we could
</I>&gt;<i> somehow integrate the timer mechanism into the Mono
</I>&gt;<i> runtime, perhaps we could get more detailed
</I>&gt;<i> information than just PC addresses (as would happen
</I>&gt;<i> with OProfile).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any suggestions on that?  What kind of timer did you
</I>&gt;<i> have in mind?
</I>
	No idea; I'd read the OProfile RTC code.

	Regards,

		Michael.
