<PRE>I think that if you just change the Console write operation with a &quot;swap&quot;
operation like this:
    tmp = a;
    a = b
    b = tmp;
you can have completely different results. And even with this test, you just
are testing how mono o .net or java deals with very few of their instruction
set.
Besides your admitting that the tests are without any significance for every
application but your, your application benchmark (testing the console output
performance) is useless for most other different applications and may lead
to confusion.
We at Tipic, Inc. are trying to evaluate Mono Performance on a real
application (at designing/alpha stage) and we got that actually both MS libs
and MS.Jit ouperform Mono on small/simple benchmarks; but the performance
gap gets smaller when some &quot;real&quot; (complex) algorithms are done (maybe
algorithms different from what is already implemented in the CLR ;-) ): this
make us think that Mono is designed to be a general purpose Jit, optimizing
everything with the same accuracy, while .NET, instead, does some operations
with much more accuracy.
