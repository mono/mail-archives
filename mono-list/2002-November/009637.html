Norbert,

I see several challenges for your scheme. (please refer to my later post
&quot;Mono/Java interop - Usage scenarios&quot; for more context) 

1. Java and .Net types are not unified and thus still incompatible; have
you actually achieved &quot;interoperability&quot;? 

Eg imagine I wish to use a Java formatting library to format a String I
have in .Net. The formatted Java String I have can never be used in my
CLR in place of a .Net string, because they are distinct types. Imagine
the following C# code, using your wrapper system.

java.lang.String s = new String(&quot;abc);
java.lang.String formatted = java.formatter.MyFormatter.format(s);

//this line will blow up, because java.lang.String != string
TextField.setText(formatted);


Do you see the problem? You cannot have substatial interoperability
without some shared understanding; that is, some degree of unification
of the type systems. Otherwise you have parallel worlds, which can only
exchange information via primitives, and that's primitive ;)

2. Performance using proxies for all objects passed across the bridge
will be extremely poor in the remote bridging scenario. Every access to
the objects fields will involve a remote call! Not such a problem for
in-process bridging, however.

Regards
Ben
