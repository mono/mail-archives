<PRE>re all,

well, it's certainly affected by, but obviously this tiny bench
does not solely measure the performance of the terminal/console
and its scrolling. else the measured differences (most of them
being significant at a confidence level of 95%) between the
runtime environments of the same os platform could not be
explained.

the bench could be much better of course :) admittedly, i did not
take the time to write a nice, more or less representative
benchmark (which is a difficult &quot;political&quot; task btw). but this
was not the goal anyway. i just wanted to quickly compare the
relative performance of the runtime environments for that
particular task. there is no claim for representation or
generalization at all. and i did not want to compare linux vs.
windows either (perhaps the second point in the conclusions is
misleading, i think i should remove it).

nevertheless i was surprised by some of the results. regardless
of the influence of the terminal performance itself i expected a
&quot;home run&quot; of the ms clr on windows. but mono appears to be
significantly faster (in the context of this specific task). as
well, i did not expect mono to beat java on windows (dito). i do
not know the reason for this however (perhaps you know?).

another thing which surprised me were the quite different cil
file sizes generated with the mono and ms compiler respectively.
i did not further analyze this though.

regards

dan
