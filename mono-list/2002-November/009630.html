<PRE>Hello

&gt;<i> I have been looking the GNOME.NET tutorial and I suggest that all the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation that we will write follow the DocBook style. It is too
</I>&gt;<i> easy to learn and we have all the portability that we need.
</I>
I have a problem with Docbook myself.  

We have been using Docbook since the early days of the GNOME project,
because in theory you can get grandiose output out of it.

In practice, Docbook is tedious to write, and the output is always
horrible.  I have yet to see in the five years we have been using
Docbook a single stylesheet that does not look massively ugly.

Creating Docbook documents is also hard.  Of course some people will
advocate using Emacs + Psgml, but then learning these tools is almost as
hard as reading the Docbook book.

I know that in theory its possible to fix, but we have yet to see such a
beast.   

My suggestion: focus on the content first, and later on the format. 
stick to HTML, and once you have materials ready, have a volunteer
translate it to Docbook (if they ever get their act together and it does
not look like bad HTML pages for 1991).

Miguel
