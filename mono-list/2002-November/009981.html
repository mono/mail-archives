I am currently running Windows 2000 on 50 PC's.  I am developing new
software for my company in VB.NET and winforms.  I will store my data in a
MS-SQL server database.  As I understand it, I should be able to use your
software on a Linux box to run my VB.NET software.  As I see it, this would
save me from having to purchase 50 copies of the next operating system @
$200 each.  I should be able to run my software on a Linux box.  That would
be a big money saver for me.  Any guess as to when your software will be
ready for me to use?  It said in the FAQ that this would be available
commercially, any idea how much (budget purposes only)?  How many zeros are
we talking.  Anything else I should know?  My software will not be finished
for at least a year and maybe two.  So I am not in a huge hurry.
