<PRE>hello!

&gt;<i> Although similar, I don't think the two libraries are close enough to
</I>&gt;<i> perform this mapping successfully. I think such an approach will provide
</I>&gt;<i> shallow interoperability that initally looks good, but worsens the more
</I>&gt;<i> complexity you introduce. My personal feeling is that cross-compilation
</I>&gt;<i> (like <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/java.html">http://www.go-mono.com/java.html</A>) doesn't add as much value as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bridging&quot;...
</I>
I think you should handle specially a few classes, and the rest would
come from an existing class library like GNU Classpath.

&gt;<i> (c) Complex pass-by-value objects which likely as not have no
</I>&gt;<i> representation in the other framework; imagine sending eg a
</I>&gt;<i> javax.swing.JButton to .Net (remember it cant instatiate it directly as
</I>&gt;<i> .Net doesn't understand the Java class definition). How is .Net going to
</I>&gt;<i> handle this piece of data?
</I>
It is a problem for a full bridge, but not for a common subset.  For
example, take the .NET Common Type System (CTS): it defines a subset of
the features available to languages (and it is for example a subset of
C#, not every C# feature can be exposed to the CTS).

Trying to solve the very complex problem of a perfect mapping is the
path to oblivion, you want to make a compromise, and go for a subset. 
CORBA for instance defines a nice subset that maps to a number of modern
languages. 

&gt;<i> Since this is a .Net focused list, I guess there is greater interest in
</I>&gt;<i> making Java work with .Net than the other way round. Therefore,
</I>&gt;<i> obtaining or producing some specification of the Remoting binary
</I>&gt;<i> protocol seems a critical early step. This may mean reverse-engineering
</I>&gt;<i> it from the shared source CLI.
</I>
Well, I would be interested in having a BinaryFormatter implementation,
as we do not even have one today, but from the looks of it, its probably
the worst thing we can do.

I really want to encourage people to work on a CORBA implementation.

Miguel
