<PRE>Hi all,

I have been trying to figure out as to how exactly does
the mono code run over Cygwin, which happens to be a windows
program. I was not surprised to find out that the
entire mono code has been made keeping Glib in mind
and that the glib which is shipped for Windows actually
uses the Windows API's. (same for iconv and intl).

I even tried to write a small code in Microsoft Visual
Studio which uses only &lt;glib.h&gt;, glib functions/datatypes
and the glib-2.0.lib + libglib-2.0-0.dll and it works
fine. Does this mean that if I try to build the mono 
code from Microsoft Visual Studio taking care of all 
the dependencies, it ought to give me mono.exe/mint.exe
at the end.

I have found that the &lt;windows.h&gt; (from /include/w32api)
which has been used within the mono code might try to be
a stepping stone for the process. If that (plus the dependency
on some other *linux* header files is resolved), would
building mint/mono on Microsoft Visual Studio be a healthy
exercise or am I just breaking my head against the wall. :-)

I would like to know if there is anyone who has tried
this before/if it is possible or not?

Thanks,
~Piyush
