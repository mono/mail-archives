<PRE>&gt;<i> Now, you need to compile your own Mono from CVS, 
</I>&gt;<i> because the System.Web code has changed tremendously 
</I>&gt;<i> since the official release.
</I>
I'm currently running the latest debianplanet packages which are
compiled from CVS (occasionally).  I think what I have was built a
little over a week ago.

Trying to get the CVS stuff compiling now.  I just saw the pointer to
the monocharge tarball - I think that's what I need to get past where
I'm currently stuck (I'm getting all 0-byte DLLs just like the other guy
that posted here).

&gt;<i> Once you get your CVS version of Mono running, get 
</I>&gt;<i> the `xsp' module, which contains a test server for 
</I>&gt;<i> ASP.NET, and start throwing .aspx programs at it 
</I>
Okay, I compiled xsp and got it running in my current mono environment.
It serves simple .aspx pages just fine, but I haven't had any luck with
custom controls or code-behind as of yet.  Hoping to find some
documentation or archived mailing list posts to help me. &lt;grin&gt;

&gt;<i> As you test, you will run into various bugs that 
</I>&gt;<i> will require investigative work, debugging works, 
</I>&gt;<i> and implementation work. 
</I>
I'll be glad to help debug System.Web if I can.  Any pointers to the
required tools and how to get them set up?

&gt;<i> You have the exact match of talent needed to help 
</I>&gt;<i> in this area!
</I>
&lt;grin&gt;  Well, I'm really enjoying working with ASP.NET on Windows.  I
hope that mono becomes just as capable sometime soon.  I'm willing to
help in the short term to achieve that goal.

&gt;<i> A howto would be awesome, but the interesting thing 
</I>&gt;<i> about asp.net is that most knowledge can be 
</I>&gt;<i> transfered from Microsoft .NET to Mono without 
</I>&gt;<i> changes.
</I>
I'd like to author something to help people without any Microsoft
ASP.NET experience get started using mono's implementation.

Later,
-Zak
