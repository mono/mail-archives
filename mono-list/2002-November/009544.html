<PRE>Hello!

&gt;<i> However IMHO it would be bad if you start treating it as more than a
</I>&gt;<i> good test case.
</I>
Well, this is kind of a weekend thing.  You have to admit that that this
JUMP thing is a fun toy.

&gt;<i> &gt; 	* The change to run Eclipse on a full open source platform
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're using a proprietry non-open-source tool to compile it,
</I>&gt;<i> then it's not a full open source platform, is it?
</I>&gt;<i> The tool chain is part of the platform, IMHO.
</I>
Yeah, you are right, maybe some forking would have to happen at that
point.  Or forking of select pieces could happen, pieces that could be
easily reused by SharpDevelop for instance.

&gt;<i> So I don't see what the advantage of this would be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	* Convince Microsoft to open source JUMP ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good luck -- I think you'll need it! ;-)
</I>
I really think its on their best interest.  See, what is the point of
keeping JUMP proprietary?  It is a free download today, and would  help
their strategy of moving people from Java to C#.

Myself being more of a fan of C# over Java, I can only hope to move all
the cool Java code over to C# ;-)

La la la,
Miguel
