 &gt; Hello,

 &gt;
 &gt;&gt;1)
 &gt;&gt;High Integration with SysV daemon structure: each mono service is a
 &gt;&gt;different SysV daemon.
 &gt;&gt;See Mathias previous post for an analysis of this option.
 &gt;&gt;2)
 &gt;&gt;A unique SysV process which will be the MONO.SCM: each mono service 
will be
 &gt;&gt;managed by these process.
 &gt;&gt;See Mathias and Kai previous posts for an analysis of this option.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; Remember that Mono is not tied to Linux, so using a solution which is
 &gt; cross-platform would be my recommended approach.
 &gt;
 &gt; So basically that means, rolling our own system to launch/shutdown
 &gt; processes.  This has the added benefit, that a single daemon can be
 &gt; started, and we can have as much tight integration with this as we want.
 &gt;
 &gt; We can always have a `monoservices' init.d script for the SysV to
 &gt; launch, and this one in turn would load the definitions for Mono
 &gt; services from a Mono-controlled directory, but that way we minimize the
 &gt; integration work, and maximize flexibility.

I'm also voting for the mono based service manager. Additionally to the
compatibility issue I could imagine that we also would gain some
efficience from using a mono based service manager: See the Mono runtime
would be launched only once (potentially faster startup) and as long as
not explicitly requested to deal it different all the services could
life in appdomains of the same mono vm...

Ciao,
Mathias
