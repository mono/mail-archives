<PRE>What is mentioned at <A HREF="http://www.go-mono/ado-net.html">http://www.go-mono/ado-net.html</A> refers Mono.Data.MySql
and uses MySQL native client library.  It is under the X11/MIT license.
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php</A>

The reason Mono.Data.MySQL falls under the X11 license is because the Mono
class libraries are under the X11 license.

The mono runtime is under GPL and the mcs C# compiler is under LGPL.

As for the pure C# provider at
 <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqlnet/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqlnet/</A>
This provider does not require a MySQL client library at all.
You have to use anonymous cvs to check it out.

This is the cvs web page that tells you how to use
annoymous cvs to get a copy of mysqlnet.  However, it is GPL.  It does not
run on Mono, but it runs fine on MS .NET.  This is how I got it.  I removed
the System.Web.Forms and System.Draw stuff.  Miguel was quick on fixing a
bug for me that I discovered trying to run it on Mono.

</I>

I think I need to understand better what clients are available, and why
there may be two (or more) written for .NET in C# and under GPL.

There is Mono.Data.MySQL. Coded in C# and currently 'heavily' under
development, written by Daniel Morgan, Rodrigo Moya, Ravi Pratap and
Brad Merrill.  Under GPL.

Is this the one which uses the libmySQL.dll and linmysqlclient.so?

Or is this the one which is pure C#, but may suffer in the future as it
may fall behind the MySQL protocol?

Is this the official 'mono' MySQL API you refered to?


There is also <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqlnet/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqlnet/</A> which is also
GPL.  Also C#.  Written by Jun Su, Reggie Burnett and Adam Hunger. This
currently shows no files, so i can't look at it.  This currently has
problems with Mono, but you have a working version.

There is another .NET MySQL driver written in C# by Manuel Lucas Viñas
Livschitz, also GPL.  Is this the same one, I can't seem to find the
page where I downloaded this.

There is the one from <A HREF="http://www.einfodesigns.com/.">http://www.einfodesigns.com/.</A>  Not GPL.

This is the ONLY official .NET API from MySQL on
<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/portal/software/html/software-32-1.html.">http://www.mysql.com/portal/software/html/software-32-1.html.</A>  Which
seems odd as MySQL seem to encourage the stong use of GPL API's.


If you can enlighten me a little, I would be greatful.

&gt;<i> The MySQL provider in Mono right now uses a native client shared
</I>&gt;<i> library: on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows, this shared library is libmySQL.dll and on Linux, it is
</I>&gt;<i> libmysqlclient.so
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A MySQL provider written in 100% C# would be better for performance
</I>&gt;<i> reasons,
</I>&gt;<i> but that would mean we would have to keep up with the client/server
</I>&gt;<i> protocol
</I>&gt;<i> used for MySQL database access.  At least with MySQL's native client
</I>&gt;<i> library, the API is stable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a GPL'ed MySQL provider in sourceforge.net and works on .NET, but
</I>&gt;<i> it does not work on Mono due to problems in I/O or networking (I assume)
</I>&gt;<i> right now.  I have a modified version on my hard drive if interested.
</I>&gt;<i>  I had
</I>&gt;<i> to strip out the Windows.Forms and System.Drawing stuff in there since we
</I>&gt;<i> don't need that for Mono.  This provider is written in 100% C# and

</I>&gt;<i> MySQL
