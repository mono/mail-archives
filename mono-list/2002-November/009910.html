<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> For the sake of the non-GNOME people on the list, the exact same
</I>&gt;<i> brouhaha happened with GNOME. What eventually happened after the uproar
</I>&gt;<i> died down was, as Adam suggests here, a division of the list into
</I>&gt;<i> gnome-hackers and gnome-private. gnome-hackers continued on as a &quot;core
</I>&gt;<i> development&quot; list[1], and gnome-private faded into the background,
</I>&gt;<i> playing the role of ultimate puppet master, waiting for the day to
</I>&gt;<i> announce to the world that yes, it does INDEED have a doomsday device,
</I>&gt;<i> and is not afraid to use it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Okay, I made that last bit up. But the point remains that such a
</I>&gt;<i> division is entirely workable, and Miguel has already been through a
</I>&gt;<i> similar one, and I'm sure he will handle the current situation just as
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably.
</I>
In fact, when I made mono-hackers and there was a debate a year ago, I
promised to create a new mailing list (maybe mono-devel-list) which I
failed to do due to work overload.

The right solution is to create mono-devel-list, I will ask for the list
to be created, but I am going to Mexico tomorrow morning, and wont have
time to set it up until Thursday.

Juli has given a good description of why a private mailing list is
required for an inner group.

Best wishes,
Miguel.
