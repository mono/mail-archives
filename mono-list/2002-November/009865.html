<PRE>hi,

Im new to this list, so Ill take a brief moment for a little introduction :)

I started programming small programs for the Amiga many years ago. Nowadays I
do use Windows mostly, and a small bit of linux. The reason for being is that, to the
best of my knowledge, I dont think there are any development environments for linux
which are like Visual Studio...I saw KDevelop but it seems *really* unstable on my machine
so I don't use it very much. I mostly program C++ and some ASM, but currently I am messing about with
C#.

I havn't, yet, got to download stuff off <A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com">http://www.go-mono.com</A> - From reading the website I think
i got the general jist of it anyway...

Just two questions for the moment :-

Does anyone know if .NET Frameworks on platforms other than windows will support the
portable executable file output from Visual Studio .NET ? (i.e. If I complie a program on
Visual Studio .NET, will the outputted executable byte code run on linux with mono installed?)
or would different executables still be required ?

Is there a proper term for .NET byte code - or is that actually the technical term for it ?

thanks in advance,

Peter
