And that is absolutely fine.  If Miguel does not wish to share confidential 
information with me then that is entirely his prerogative.  I don't quite 
understand why, but it is his company (well not really, but you know what I 
mean ;) and he can do whatever he wants with such information.

The problem stems from the nature of the mono-hackers list and the 
consequences of limiting participation on technical discussions of Mono to 
those with no avowed interest in, or support of, similar projects.  Once 
again, I don't mind Ximian limiting access to confidential information.  I am 
concerned about limiting access to technical discussions because of an 
expressed interest in a competing project.

Cheers,

Adam
