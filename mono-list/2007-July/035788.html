</I>Hi!

Any idea where can I find the source for the !!! -devel !!! packages? My 
distro is not GNOME based and it doesn't come with the devel packages. I 
can't find them anywhere on the internet. The packages that are on the 
mono-project site do not contain such things and as such mono doesn't 
compile at all :(.
Thank you for the advice!
