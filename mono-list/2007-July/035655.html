C++ is especially bad if you want to use the toolkit with Mono (think  
p/invoke!).

Regarding Gtk+ and managed toolkits you might be interested in this  
proposed project, a new managed widget for Gtk#:
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/StudentProjects#GTK.23_Work">http://www.mono-project.com/StudentProjects#GTK.23_Work</A>
So if you have a problem with extensibility of a C based toolkit like  
Gtk+ you can just as well try to extend it with your favorite managed  
language and see how that works out.

We could certainly argue about toolkit design from a native viewpoint  
(where object-oriented features like C++ might be desirable for a  
developer) but from a managed viewpoint QT bindings appear to have  
taken a very long time to be completed (1.0.0 just released this  
month) while Gtk# is stable for years already. It can also be a  
licensing question of LGPL vs. GPL/commercial dual-license, apart  
from any language considerations.
