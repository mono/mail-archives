<PRE>Miguel de Icaza escribi&#243;:
&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know if the mono team plans to implement that (I thing there's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no mid-term plan for start hacking on it), but is mostly like having to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write another toolkit from scratch, am I wrong?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some code exists, but we are not focusing on it yet, there are many
</I>&gt;<i> other pieces that are required.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe that's the reason we're never gonna have it. It would be nice to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have it, anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe the implementation of Moonlight could lead to WPF in the end?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> They look very similar, but we believe that we will end up with another
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.   We will probably learn a lot from Moonlight, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> some of the high-level code can be reused (like the widgets built on top
</I>&gt;<i> of the engine).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From my humble point of view... it seems like GTK+ is getting too hard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to update and add new things due to it being written in C or other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues. It seems like Qt is much more better designed, and so could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WPF, but this can be completely false as I'm not an expert in this topic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are willing to break compatibility, plenty of things can be done.
</I>&gt;<i> But breaking compatibility is not high on the list of the Gtk+ folks
</I>&gt;<i> (and I suspect the Qt folks as well).
</I>
Thanks for all the info.

&gt;<i> But we do agree that you do not know much about what you are talking
</I>&gt;<i> about.
</I>
Was that really needed? When someone says in advance he may be wrong
there's no need to say, &quot;hey you really have not f***ing idea!&quot;. You
really didn't seem that kind of guy.

Anyway, thanks for all.

Cheers!
