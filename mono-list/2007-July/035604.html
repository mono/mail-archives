</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ah, I guess it's purely philosophical then.  Basically boiling down to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Do we really need *another* toolkit&quot;?  We have to have WinForms to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide compatibility with the .Net framework.  And we need GTK# to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono a great choice for Linux (and somewhat cross-platform) apps.  (And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there are others like QT and wxNet and Cocoa#.)  So what would another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; toolkit bring?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Writing an entire toolkit is hard and expensive.  WinForms has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under development for probably 4 years having up to 6 people working on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it full-time as well as plenty of contributors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't really know of any benefit to making another one.  WinForms is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already &quot;Mono native&quot; in that it's fully done with System.Drawing.  It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems like a new one would simply take the WinForms widgets and change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the API simply for the sake of being different.  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess he's not asking 'why not doing another toolkit using S.D.' but
</I>&gt;<i> 'why not redo Gtk# using S.D.'. I guess the disadvantages of that would
</I>&gt;<i> be less performance and much time needed to write it, but in the end it
</I>&gt;<i> would be a managed toolkit and many problems that Gtk# has already,
</I>&gt;<i> would blow, don't you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My concerns are about:

1. I know Mono intends to be a Microsoft .NET implementation on Unix,
and a library like System.Windows.Forms is totally needed;  though I
do not like the SWF APIs [ok, programming GUI applications with SWF is
easier than programming them with, by example, Java Swing; but you do
not have the MVC separation and all the elegant way of controlling
things].

2. GTK+ is a nice library and Gtk# is a good binding, but again, we
are tied to the computer infrastructure.

Having a Mono specific UI library, maybe built on top of the current
implementation of SWF but feeling free to implement new things [not
necessarily compatible with Microsoft's SWF implementation] could add
a lot of value and richness to the Mono library [theming, KDE and
Gnome interoperability, etc.]

Having a Gtk# implementation built on top of System.Drawing could also
be valuable in the same way.

Yes, I know that it is like reinvent the wheel, but also means turning
Mono in a more independent (and thus, complete) platform.

Kind regards,


Ernesto
