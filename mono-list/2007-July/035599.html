<PRE>Jonathan Pobst escribi&#243;:
&gt;<i> Ah, I guess it's purely philosophical then.  Basically boiling down to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Do we really need *another* toolkit&quot;?  We have to have WinForms to 
</I>&gt;<i> provide compatibility with the .Net framework.  And we need GTK# to make 
</I>&gt;<i> Mono a great choice for Linux (and somewhat cross-platform) apps.  (And 
</I>&gt;<i> there are others like QT and wxNet and Cocoa#.)  So what would another 
</I>&gt;<i> toolkit bring?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Writing an entire toolkit is hard and expensive.  WinForms has been 
</I>&gt;<i> under development for probably 4 years having up to 6 people working on 
</I>&gt;<i> it full-time as well as plenty of contributors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't really know of any benefit to making another one.  WinForms is 
</I>&gt;<i> already &quot;Mono native&quot; in that it's fully done with System.Drawing.  It 
</I>&gt;<i> seems like a new one would simply take the WinForms widgets and change 
</I>&gt;<i> the API simply for the sake of being different.  :)
</I>
I guess he's not asking 'why not doing another toolkit using S.D.' but 
'why not redo Gtk# using S.D.'. I guess the disadvantages of that would 
be less performance and much time needed to write it, but in the end it 
would be a managed toolkit and many problems that Gtk# has already, 
would blow, don't you think?
