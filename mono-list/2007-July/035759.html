<PRE>aaron,

as far as i know you should resolve version conflict in mono/.NET by
linking to specific versions in the GAC. but just like you are new to
open-source, i&#180;m new to .NET :-)

since you report problems with installers, backwards incompatibilities
etc., maybe you should refer to a more specific list like
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-list">gtk-sharp-list at ximian.com</A> (for gtk#) and <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-list">gtk-list at gnome.org</A> for
(gtk+), talk to the guys and track down possible bugs, file bug
reports if needed etc.

about licensing, from the gtk+ FAQ,
&quot;GTK+ is free software and part of the GNU Project. However, the
licensing terms for GTK+, the GNU LGPL, allow it to be used by all
developers, including those developing proprietary software, without
any license fees or royalties.&quot;

i guess the same applies to gtk#, where you would be just linking to
the libraries, and not exactly modifying sources...

&gt;<i> 2 - Rip all necessary DLLs from the Gtk# installer (that would
</I>&gt;<i> include Gtk+ DLLs) from Novell and put them in my bin directory upon
</I>&gt;<i> installation. This is the most attractive option, and should be the
</I>&gt;<i> most reliable option. This would be a pretty flagrant violation of
</I>&gt;<i> copyright (or something) though, wouldn't it?
</I>
i don&#180;t see violation but I could well be wrong. can anyone else
elaborate on this?


if tou can&#180;t get past this issues, you could try windows.forms
support, it&#180;s getting better as mono evolves. in any case, i don&#180;t
think &quot;legal&quot; issues should stop you from using gtk#.


best regards from a newbie mono fan :-)
