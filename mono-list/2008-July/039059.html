Hello,

&gt;<i> Hi, I have a CentOS 5.2 box running Apache 2.2 (which is tested and serving

</I>Get the srpm for the mod_mono module, modify the spec file to configure the sources
with --enable-debug. Install the new rpm and run your app - the apache error log
should contain more information. Basically what's happening is that either the
mod-mono-server.exe backend isn't found or that it's failing at the start for some
reason (sigabrt, sigsegv etc). You might want to use the strace tool to attach to
the apache process and have it follow forks (-f or -ff if you want separate files)
to see if the mod-mono-server process is started at all.

best,

marek
