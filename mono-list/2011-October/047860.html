<PRE>Hi, Fellows:

I have conceived a new paradigam of programming language, and believed that
it could be the future of programming language, even though the idea is
simple enough. Here is an abstract of it:

&quot;Type expressiveness is defined in this paper as a convention to use public
getters to reveal each type&#8217;s information in a self-contained way so that
its instance can be cloned, serialized and persisted by reflecting on the
type definition only.  Type expressiveness can be the foundation to allow
data exchange between different address spaces created by same or different
computer languages.

A new behavior descriptive entity type called spec is proposed, which
combines the traditional interface with test rules and test cases, to
completely specify the desired behavior of each method, and to enforce the
behavior-wise correctness of all compiled units.  

The combination of type expressiveness and spec results in a new programming
paradigm, which allows the separation programming space into (1) a behavior
domain to aggregate all behavior coding in the format of spec, (2) a object
domains to bind each concrete spec to its data representation in a
particular address space, and (3) a realization domain to transfer data
between the address spaces using the type expressiveness.  Such separation
guarantees the strictness of behavior satisfaction at compile time, while
allows flexibility of dynamical binding of actual implementation at
runtime.&quot;

Please visit my site <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expressivetype">http://sourceforge.net/projects/expressivetype</A> for
details.

I have finished the type expressiveness part using C# and I am working on to
demonstrate the rest using C# reflection.  Then I realize that this is a
compiler problem because what I am doing now is quite wastefull.  I wonder
if I can customize mono to acheive my goal.  Is there a document about how
to customize mono?  In my paper I have laid out detailed compilation and
linking process as simple steps, but I need a way to implement it.

Please drop me a line of two if your are interest.  All comments (including
negative comments) are welcomed.


Regards,
Chengpu Wang
