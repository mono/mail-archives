<PRE>In an earlier post, I asked about using mono for
cross-platform GUI development.  For this purpose, mono
seems to have a good prospect, as managed forms are
supported by native backends (Quartz on OS X, X11 on
GNU/Linux, and Win32-or-whatever-you-call-it on MS Windows).

OS X, however, has at least one prominent peculiarity: the
menu bar.  It seems that managed forms under mono-1.1.4 draw
the application's main menu in the application window.  Does
anyone know whether the mono-on-OS-X team plans eventually
to put the application's main menu into the OS X menu bar?
(If not, then I might investigate Qt#, as someone else on
this list suggested.)

As I noted in my post about the dotfield game that I wrote
to test out the possibility of using mono and managed forms
from cross-platform GUI development, there is a small set of
anomalies that appear unique to mono-on-OS-X:

- Drawing is *really* a lot slower (order of magnitude?) on
  OS X than on GNU/Linux or MS Windows.

- The right mouse button appears to the application as if it
  were the left button.

- CTRL and SHIFT modifier keys on mouse click aren't visible
  to the application.  (This is a big drag, given the
  previous bullet.)

- The commanded size of the main form, at least in my toy
  application, needed a mysterious extra 22 pixels or so in
  height in order for every control to be visible.  On
  GNU/Linux or MS Windows, the same executable (that has a
  nicely fit window on OS X) generates rather a too-tall
  window.
