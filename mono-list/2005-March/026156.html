<PRE>Since I began working with Mono I have got several problems running
NAnt on top of Mono. Today I upgraded to Mono 1.1.4 and to NAnt
0.85-rc2 hopping that I would not have to do some mambo jambo to get
them working together. However it happens that NAnt does not run on
Mono 1.1.4 because of some XML bug in Mono, that was solved, but not
incorporated in Mono 1.1.4.

Every time I try to compile Mono from SVN I always get some wierd
errors, so I do not see getting Mono SVN as a solution that will work
on me.

I am starting to think that I am the only developer that is developing
an application in Windows and Linux, at the same time, that uses NAnt
as a works-everywhere tool. Otherwise, solving this Mono vs NAnt
issues would be important.

So, what are your sugestions if I want a build tool that will work on
Microsoft .NET and Mono? Please, no IDE and no Makefile's!
