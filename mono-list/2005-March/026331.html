</I>Yes, GTK# is fully ported to Windows/Mono and is the platform of choice for developing GUI applications on all platforms (currently Win32, Linux, MacOSX AFAIK, pls correct me if I'm wrong). 

Now, about the database, I'm not sure. I think SQLite works on both Windows and Linux (there's also a mono/C# api for it). IIRC PostgreSQL is cross-platform and, again, IIRC mono has an ODBC implementation which should allow you to connect to virtually any database.

Well, else what can I say? If you've coded in VB6 before, stick to VB.Net. Mono has the mbas compiler which allows you to compile vb programs. C# and VB.Net, from a structural point of view are similar, VERY similar, and 99% of the times converting from C# to VB.net and vice versa is extremely easy, so you should find enough examples on the net.


Hope this helps... Good luck!
