<PRE>This issue comes up every few months. If everyone quit distributing software 
because of fear that the software *might* infringe on someone's patent, 
nothing would ever get distributed.

Also, even if MS were to agree not to enforce any patents that Mono might 
violate, that does not mean that some company other than MS might try to 
enforce their patents.

By your logic, Fedora should stop distributing the Linux kernel until they 
have patent releases from HP, since the Linux kernel might violate some 
patent related to VMS.
