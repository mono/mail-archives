<PRE>hi paul,

i can indeed build it that way, however since 1.1.3 mono has simplified 
support  for &quot;bundles&quot; which include the program in question, along with 
any and all needed mono runtimes. for fun i decided to read all the release 
notes, just to see if there were any features that i had overlooked. and 
what did i find? the feature that i had been waiting for ever since i had 
found out that people needed runtimes for .NET/mono applications (quite a 
while ago). (well, 1 of 2 top features, the other one being SWF.) more 
details are available here: <A HREF="http://go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3/">http://go-mono.com/archive/1.1.3/</A> along with 
the man page for mkbundle.

i suppose it would make sense to need gcc right? i mean compiling an 
application to a machine executable binary, one would need some kind of 
compiler other then the mono one, along with a linker etc.

thanks for the reply,
joe
