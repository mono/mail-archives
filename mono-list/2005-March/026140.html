<PRE>Hi,=20

On a windows 2000 machine I've installed mono 1.1.4, and I've been =
looking at the gtk# demo app bundled with the release. I've created a =
Visual Studio project with all the .cs files and the right references (I =
think!). I can send on the csproj file. It compiled easily under Visual =
Studio 2003 which is niceI had problems getting it to run, using the =
microsoft .NET framework (1.1). First I was getting dll problems, I =
think it was libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll not being found. A post I found in a =
mono list led me to installing the &quot;gtk runtime for windows&quot;, I used =
gtksharp-runtime-1.9.2-win32-0.3.exe. This resolved the dll problem. =
Then an unresolved problem loading Pixbufs, the app hangs at line 141 of =
DemoMain.cs :
	Gdk.Pixbuf pixbuf =3D Gdk.Pixbuf.LoadFromResource (&quot;gtk-logo-rgb.gif&quot;); =
The message is:

&quot;Une exception non g=E9r=E9e du type 'System.ArgumentException' s'est =
produite dans gdk-sharp.dll

Informations suppl=E9mentaires=A0: resource must be a valid resource =
name of 'assembly'.&quot;

Yes it's in French, sorry. Now I've tried a couple of things, but no =
joy:=20
-Tried changing BuildAction on the image files
                &lt;File
                    RelPath =3D &quot;images\gtk-logo-rgb.gif&quot;
                    BuildAction =3D &quot;EmbeddedResource&quot;
                /&gt;
or
                &lt;File
                    RelPath =3D &quot;images\gtk-logo-rgb.gif&quot;
                    BuildAction =3D &quot;Content&quot;
                /&gt;...
-Tried making a satellite assembly using the MS tool reseditor, =
containing the images, tried using assembly linker tool al.exe... Maybe =
I'm not going about it right.
-Tried looking at mono Doc : =
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/monodoc.ashx?link=3DT%3aGdk.Pixbuf">http://www.go-mono.com/docs/monodoc.ashx?link=3DT%3aGdk.Pixbuf</A>

So my question is how do I get LoadFromResource to work?
Actually I have put the line in comments and without using =
LoadFromResource the app runs fine under windows .NET

Also I have a comment, I was interested in prj2make# but it took me a =
very long while to figure out the following syntax (might help someone):
&gt;<i>call C:\PROGRA~1\MONO-1~1.4\bin\setmonopath.bat
</I>&gt;<i>nmake /f MakefileMcsWin32
</I>I ended up having to copy 5 dlls {&quot;x-sharp&quot;, x in {gtk, gdk, pango, atk, =
glib}} to the root directory of the app.

I'm very impressed that I can compile it with visual studio and then run =
it &quot;mono GtkDemo.exe&quot;, even though there do seem to be more bugs in my =
VS-compiled version of the demo than in the bundled one.

How come mono IL and windows IL are so similar? Could anyone explain (or =
give links) about the differences between the IL generated by mcs and =
that generated by csc? Should we expect 100% interopability?

Thanks,

Malcolm Schonfield
