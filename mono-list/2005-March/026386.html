<PRE> &quot;Serious development implies a staging/development server, so I simply

Perhaps Nik is speaking more to a production environment than a development
environment where apache restarts are disruptive.  Especially where a shared
web server is concerned.  Sounds like this will be a mute issue soon when
fixed.

I think it's important to point out we're not just talking about attracting
MS programmers who know C# and want cross-platform ability, we're also
talking about system integrators that need to be educated about what is
different from what they are used to and how best to succeed with mono.
They want to know how they can deploy and quickly be up and running with
minimal effort and maximum reliability. Jeopardizing either one will be a
deterent.

Currently, the mono site is very developer centric.  Perhaps the site could
quickly qualify a visitor as a devloper or system integrator and route them
to the mono portal with the information that best fits their needs.

Nik,

&gt;<i> ASP.NET
</I>&gt;<i>  From <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/ASP.NET">http://www.mono-project.com/ASP.NET</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Both are fully functional at this point.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is somewhat disingenuous.  A .net web developer is going to 
</I>&gt;<i> presume that this means it works just like IIS and .Net but on linux 
</I>&gt;<i> with mono and apache.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It doesnt work on windows with apache and mono It doesnt work on OSX 
</I>&gt;<i> with apache and mono It works on linux - but only if your idea of good 
</I>&gt;<i> systems administration includes restarting apache everytime you make a 
</I>&gt;<i> change to your site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know there is a bug open about it, i know there is a control panel 
</I>&gt;<i> work around.  But really, ASP.Net development with mono is completely 
</I>&gt;<i> unuseable for real world situations on any platform.  This is despite 
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that most of it is pretty much there waiting to be used.
</I>
I don't agree with this point.

Sure, it would be nicer if XSP+mod_mono would behave more like ASP.NET+IIS,
but this is not an issue for professional ASP.NET/XSP development.

Serious development implies a staging/development server, so I simply don't
care whether I have to restart Apache or not: it's just a script that gets
called after a sucessful build.
