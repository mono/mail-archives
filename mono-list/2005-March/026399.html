For my case I have this kind of problem. I cannot restart Apache every
time, because someone can be doing download or viewing stream video or
audio.

Like someone said in this thread, this feature is more useful for
Production Environment. I don't imagine one hosting enterprise doing
restart of the Apache every time a user change is WebSite.

I will wait for the end of the year for new changes.
