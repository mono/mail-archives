<PRE>Enough with this patent FUD fear from you!

Have you been watching too much X-files lately?

I have to agree with marcus.  Should Red Hat, Novell/Suse, etc... stop 
distributing Linux because of the SCO lawsuit? 
No, because we all know SCO is wrong.

Should I drop everything because someone like you who is ill-informed 
pops the same question over and over and over and over again?

Do you not realize that Novell has lawyers working for them that have 
advised its employess about these issues?

If you really were trying to get Mono into Fedora, you would not be 
spreading more fear.  Ever heard of the story of the boy who cried wolf?

So, do a favor for everyone and stop this unneccessary fear.
