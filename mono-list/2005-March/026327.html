Hi,

&gt;<i> Enough with this patent FUD fear from you!
</I>
Given the climate of litigation, it is hardly FUD and what I'm trying to
do is get it accepted into Fedora Core. Unfortunately, they're the ones
coming up with the arguments against it - I'm caught in the middle.

&gt;<i> Have you been watching too much X-files lately?
</I>
Dr Who man me.

&gt;<i> I have to agree with marcus.  Should Red Hat, Novell/Suse, etc... stop=20
</I>&gt;<i> distributing Linux because of the SCO lawsuit?=20
</I>&gt;<i> No, because we all know SCO is wrong.
</I>
Which is pretty much established. There are other patents to think of -
the 100 or so in the kernel for a start (okay, most belong to IBM, but
still)

&gt;<i> Should I drop everything because someone like you who is ill-informed=20
</I>&gt;<i> pops the same question over and over and over and over again?
</I>
No. I am ill informed and want to become better informed. As I've said,
I have read both sides of the argument.

&gt;<i> Do you not realize that Novell has lawyers working for them that have=20
</I>&gt;<i> advised its employess about these issues?
</I>
I'd be pretty dumb not to.

&gt;<i> If you really were trying to get Mono into Fedora, you would not be=20
</I>&gt;<i> spreading more fear.  Ever heard of the story of the boy who cried wolf?
</I>
Look. The argument FC have put up is over the patents MS hold which Mono
relies upon. Due to those patents (and again, according to the FC crew),
distribution under the GPL is not allowed. I'm not crying wolf at all
either.

&gt;<i> So, do a favor for everyone and stop this unneccessary fear.
</I>
Cautioning against trusting the word of MS is not unnecessary fear.

TTFN

Paul
