<PRE>We are pleased to announce the 0.2.10 release of the Nemerle compiler
and the language.

Nemerle is a high-level statically-typed programming language for the
.NET platform. It offers functional, object-oriented and imperative
features. It has a simple C#-like syntax and a powerful meta-programming
system.

Features that come from the functional land are variants, pattern matching
and type inference and parameter polymorphism (aka generics). Meta-system
allows great compiler extensibility, embedding domain specific languages,
partial evaluation and aspect-oriented programming.

The source tarball can be downloaded from:

 <A HREF="http://nemerle.org/download/nemerle-0.2.10.tar.gz">http://nemerle.org/download/nemerle-0.2.10.tar.gz</A>

and:

 <A HREF="http://nemerle.org/download/nemerle-0.2.10.tar.bz2">http://nemerle.org/download/nemerle-0.2.10.tar.bz2</A>

MSI, DEB and RPM packages (as well as the source tarball of course)
as usual from:

 <A HREF="http://nemerle.org/download.html">http://nemerle.org/download.html</A>

The binary packages may have a small lag to the source release.

New features in this release include (from the NEWS file). This list can
be also found nicely htmlized in a blog post:

0.2.10, Mar 31 2005
  This is another preview before 0.3.0. We have fixed a handful of bugs
  and decided to give it another shot.
  About 100 svn commits has been made since the last release.

  Additions:
    * There is Nemerle NAnt task included in the distribution.
    * The XSP (ASP.NET) integration has been tested and documented,
      please refer to <A HREF="http://nemerle.org/wiki/ASP.NET">http://nemerle.org/wiki/ASP.NET</A>
    * We do not support binary installation from tarball -- bootstrap is
      now always required.

    * A Nemerle syntax file genShi has been added to the distribution and is 
      now used in our Wiki for colorizing sources.
    * Tests are now run using Nemerle.Compiler.dll as a library -- it is 
      a lot faster.
    * New -greedy- option to disable recursive loading of assemblies.
    * We now support Windows style /options.
    * Yet incomplete support for new(), class() and struct() generic
      constraints.
  
  Bugfixes:
    * The SQL macros should now compile fine.
    * We now support creation of delegates from external static functions.
    * Installation issues with and without antlr should be now resolved.
    * Error message involving types and custom attributes should be better 
      now.
    * Quotations in response files are handled properly now.
    * Documentation updates.
    * Snapshots/SVN now use * as last part of assembly version, which should
      cure all already-installed-to-the-GAC build problems.
    * We treated type[] as a generic type with no arguments. This is fixed 
      now.
  
  Fixed bugs from our bugtracker ( <A HREF="http://nemerle.org/bugs/">http://nemerle.org/bugs/</A> )
    * #302: there should be nemerle.pc file
    * #334: Custom operators are not looked up properly (there is still
            some issues here)
    * #340: Enum options with lowercase name are wrongly understood in patterns
    * #362: access rights are not checked for property accessors
    * #372: Typer crashes when match results are first System.Enum then null
            (matching enum values)
    * #375: ice in null pattern exhaustiveness check
    * #377: wrong error message for accessing instance from another class
    * #380: nemerle from MSI package have problems with loading 
            Nemerle.Macros properly [a killer bug]
