</I>I use XSP in &quot;real world situations&quot; on Linux, and I find that it's 
hardly more of a hastle than IIS.  Your other points are valid; and I 
agree that using Microsoft technologies for .NET anything is still the 
best choice in most situations (i.e. situations in which there is no 
UNIX-based system to deal with).  I expect that, by the end of the year, 
however, Mono will be to the point that it will be a viable 
alternative.  It can never be as good, as Microsoft is for-profit, and 
will always be revising their products (C# won't be the C# we know now 
in five years, I'll warrent.  It'll be C# 3.2 and resemble VB with 
curlies or something :-P) so people &quot;upgrade,&quot; (C++ will be the C++ we 
know in five years... because M$ doesn't make money off of C++).  This 
will keep Mono one step behind at all times, not to mention trying to 
imlement all changes and additions to the .net framework. 

All the same I think that by the end of the year Mono will be usable.  
Maybe not as good as .net, but good enough to be worth choosing as a 
cost-saving measure for some.
       Cheerio,
          SigmaX

</I>&gt;<i> Sure, it would be nicer if XSP+mod_mono would behave more like
</I>&gt;<i> ASP.NET+IIS, but this is not an issue for professional ASP.NET/XSP

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Serious development implies a staging/development server,
