That was my guess ;-)
Mono-devel-list is the best one for such cases.

&gt;<i> Test cases are hard to produce, 
</I>
I 100% agree and this is why it's important for people to provide them.
Otherwise our bug fixing speed would drop significantly (to write test
cases) and a lot of bug would be closed because we wouldn't be able to
duplicate the (existing) issue (e.g. lack of important details,
environment related issues...).

A lot of time the test cases also provides the basis for new unit tests
which, in turns, diminish the likelihood that the bug will return to
haunt you (and us ;-)  

&gt;<i> because our codebase is rather large and tangled.  It's also
</I>&gt;<i> commercial .NET software, so I can't just upload the source code
</I>&gt;<i> somewhere...  
</I>
well we do have a bug preference for *small* test cases ;-)

&gt;<i> It may take me a while, because there's so much going on in our code
</I>&gt;<i> right now.  I'll get back on this. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Additionally, for some of our code, we need to write to the
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; executing directory, which is actually mono...
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Well you shouldn't be writing there ;-) and I'm not sure how
</I>&gt;<i>         you got
</I>&gt;<i>         there (bad scripts ?). You may have to write to the *current*

</I>&gt;<i>         have the 
</I>&gt;<i>         required permissions to allow this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can tell you exactly how I'm getting there.  Our licensing company
</I>&gt;<i> requires that a .xml file be present in the same directory as the
</I>&gt;<i> executing application at the time their API functions are called.
</I>&gt;<i> After many hours of debugging, I determined that the executing
</I>&gt;<i> application was actually Mono instead of our .exe.  
</I>
&gt;<i> I have no control over that bit of API code, as we're P/Invoking into
</I>&gt;<i> it.  The linux libraries do, however, work fine.  
</I>
ah, it's not managed code :|
and probably not (much) mono-aware so it consider mono as the &quot;root&quot;
executable. 

Maybe (untried) you can consider having a wrapper executable to call the
runtime ? (instead of your own mono ?)

&gt;<i> I even contacted them and they told us &quot;sorry, no other option than
</I>&gt;<i> that .xml file in the same directory&quot;.  Without that licensing, our
</I>&gt;<i> software won't run, so I think it's major enough that we request write
</I>&gt;<i> permission to those directories. 
</I>
If that's an install-time only issue then you should require someone
with su privileges to install the software. If you need to write at
every execution time then it's not an option.

&gt;<i> Is this a HUGE security issue or something?
</I>
That depends on how you fix it. Having a local mono install isn't a
security issue - but modifying /usr/bin directory permissions could be.


&gt;<i>         &gt; Anyway, we're bundling our own version of mono that's the
</I>&gt;<i>         generic x86 
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; linux distribution.  We've done a local install, and we have
</I>&gt;<i>         many
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; scripts to run our program so it uses the supplied version
</I>&gt;<i>         of mono and
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; configurations.  The problem is, there's some fixes in SVN
</I>&gt;<i>         we'd really 
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; like to have, and we don't know how long before another
</I>&gt;<i>         official
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; release will be.  So, I compiled the SVN code with a prefix
</I>&gt;<i>         of our
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; local installation, and just had it make install into that
</I>&gt;<i>         directory. 
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; Everything seemed fine at first, but I started noticing some
</I>&gt;<i>         issues
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; with our MDI relating to X11.  My question is, do I need to
</I>&gt;<i>         link
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; everything differently, so it's using the dependencies in
</I>&gt;<i>         our local 
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; installation instead of the ones installed by my
</I>&gt;<i>         distribution?
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Maybe not everything, but yes some things. For example(*) you
</I>&gt;<i>         must
</I>&gt;<i>         ensure that the libgdiplus.so being loaded is the one that
</I>&gt;<i>         match the
</I>&gt;<i>         System.Drawing.dll you use (on which System.Windows.Forms.dll
</I>&gt;<i>         depends).
</I>&gt;<i>         If not then you may experience bugs, crash, rain, lost of
</I>&gt;<i>         sleep...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will double check which libgdiplus.so it's trying to load, but I
</I>&gt;<i> compile libgdiplus with mono, and both binaries are installed in the
</I>&gt;<i> prefix.   
</I>
Keep in mind that libgdiplus was only an example. The kind of problems
likely to occur from this don't looks like your current issue.

&gt;<i> I'm mostly worried about stuff like libpng, libungif,
</I>&gt;<i> libpangosharpglue, libncurses, and other dependency packages.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want Mono to be looking for these already installed by the distro, and
</I>&gt;<i> when I distribute the software, it errors out saying it can't find
</I>&gt;<i> them.  Will mono search the MONO_PREFIX/lib/ folder at runtime if it
</I>&gt;<i> can't find the libraries elsewhere?  Will it check that first? 
</I>
There are a lot of options to change the default behavior and to make
sure they are ok (i.e. test them). See &quot;man mono&quot; for a list of options.
Many of them are also documented on the web site (e.g. for dealing with
multiple mono installations).

&gt;<i>         The best way to find out is to try your code on a fully
</I>&gt;<i>         synchronized
</I>&gt;<i>         mono version, e.g. SVN HEAD (both mono, mcs and libgdiplus).
</I>&gt;<i>         If it works
</I>&gt;<i>         then it's a result of your customized version, if not it's
</I>&gt;<i>         probably a
</I>&gt;<i>         regression (and a new bug report should be opened to ensure
</I>&gt;<i>         this is
</I>&gt;<i>         fixed prior to the next official release).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just tried with my synchronized version of SVN HEAD (r74177), and it
</I>&gt;<i> performs the exact same behavior as I'm describing.  :/
</I>
Good news, it's not your fault ;-) 
Now it's time to fill a bug report :|
