<PRE> From this message i understand that your mini-framework just loads the complete application inside one appdomain (the second one)?

If so, it's technically just restarting the application then when taking down that appdomain.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Very interesting Lluis. However, I think that these problems shouldn't

</I>&gt;<i> live and die in the second appdomain as if it were the main appdomain.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> GTK# can probably be improved to support multiple domains (even with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some limitations), but it would require an important redesign of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internals (e.g. reference tracking), and IMO the effort needed is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worth it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, perhaps in a far future we could have a completeley managed GTK#
