<PRE>Guys,

Couple of weeks ago I posted a message announcing I was ready to
release a beta version of Minosse RDBMS: that was not far from being
true, although some bugs were still blocking the release.
After 36h non-stop debugging session (I'm very proud of this) I fixed
a ton of bugs and I was able to run the system for the first time.

At the present moment there's a stopping bug that doesn't allow the
creation of tables (I know, I know: &quot;DDL it's the most important part
of data management&quot;), but the tables created by the system at
creation-time can be queried and accessed, although it is not safe to
alterate them externally.
The funny thing it's the process for creating tables internally and
externally is quite the same and if it works in the first case it
should work for the second as well: once solved this one the project
should be ready to work fully.

If you want to checkout the latest sources of the project, including
some basilar test cases to prove how it should work, you can go to
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/minossedb.">http://sourceforge.net/projects/minossedb.</A>

Thank you all for the attention.
Antonello
