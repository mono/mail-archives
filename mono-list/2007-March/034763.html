<PRE>Lluis Sanchez escribi&#243;:
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However, as Matthijs pointed out in his reply, app-domains don't play
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> well with GUI toolkits, and GTK# is not an exception.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mmmmm, why? I didn't have any information about this. Could you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ellaborate? It sounds very strange to me because I already have a 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mini-framework which supports this and uses WinForms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't tell for WinForms, but it won't work with gtk#. One problem is
</I>&gt;<i> that the GType types that gtk# creates for every managed subclass of a
</I>&gt;<i> widget are per-process, not per-assembly, and you'll get errors when
</I>&gt;<i> trying to use the same classes from different app-domains. Another
</I>&gt;<i> problem is that gtk# does not support having two managed objects to
</I>&gt;<i> represent the same GTK object. What would happen if you override the
</I>&gt;<i> OnKeyPress event on both objects? which one would be called? And even if
</I>&gt;<i> you application had an strict control on the objects and avoided
</I>&gt;<i> creating two managed objects for the same GTK object, the application
</I>&gt;<i> has no control on the main GTK thread, so for example the GTK thread
</I>&gt;<i> might receive an event for an object from domain A, while running in
</I>&gt;<i> domain B.
</I>
Very interesting Lluis. However, I think that these problems shouldn't 
arise for this feature because it wouldn't imply using objects across 
appDomains. As I understand it (and as I have coded my mini-framework), 
the only usage of AppDomain boundaries crossing would be at the 
application launch, where the launcher would &quot;launch&quot; the core of the 
addin manager (and subsequently the addins...) in a second appdomain 
configured with ShadowCopy==true. Since that launch, no other 
inter-AppDomain calls would be launched. The main program flow would 
live and die in the second appdomain as if it were the main appdomain.


&gt;<i> GTK# can probably be improved to support multiple domains (even with
</I>&gt;<i> some limitations), but it would require an important redesign of the
</I>&gt;<i> internals (e.g. reference tracking), and IMO the effort needed is not
</I>&gt;<i> worth it.
</I>
Well, perhaps in a far future we could have a completeley managed GTK# 
library. That would solve the problem too I guess :)
