<PRE>I asked the following question(s) in a Mono Community forum about a
month ago, and got no responses, so I'm trying this list instead.
Apologies in advance if the information is already out there, but I have
been searching (to no avail) for quite a while. I have a 1.1 version of
Mono built from source. The assembly &quot;System.Web.Mobile&quot; does not get
built, nor are there any Makefiles for it. However, there *are* a bunch
of files in the mcs/class/System.Web.Mobile source directory (and
subdirectories). Does anyone know the history of mobile ASP.NET support
in Mono? It looks like someone (Gaurav Vaish) wrote the code back in
2003, but maybe it no longer gets built (or is even buildable???). I
noticed that System.Web.Mobile is listed under &quot;Assemblies Under
Development&quot; for Mono 1.1. For Mono 2.0, there is mention of the fact
that ASP.NET 2.0 will be complete *minus* mobile support. Can someone
point me to some clear information on what mobile ASP.NET support is
expected to be in which versions of Mono? If I should be able to build
System.Web.Mobile and use it *now*, could you point me to info on that,
as well? Thanks!
