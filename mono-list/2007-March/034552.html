<PRE>Hi,

I'm extremely new to Mono, but a proficient C# developer.
A few years ago, I was skeptical of the prospects of this project,
since it's a clone of a proprietary, mostly closed framework that is
aggressively added to by Microsoft in short time spans. The OSS purist
within yearned for an independently cool language+framework.

Now, however, my attitude has changed as Java's language features
plateaued and they began to add features already in C#.

I've been reading more n more about functional languages and their
influence on C# 3.0, and I've been experimenting with Scheme and
Haskell.

When I get come back to work, delegates all of a sudden take on a
different meaning...
Now i think i'm kinda addicted to memoization and currying.

Has anyone been able to get them working in Mono?
like in <A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/sriram/archive/2006/01/15/lisp_is_sin.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/sriram/archive/2006/01/15/lisp_is_sin.aspx</A>

What about the Mono compiler stops the inner closure from working?

Thanks,
-Vijay
