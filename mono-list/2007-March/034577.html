Yes.  A major reason why Unix platforms don't have as many virus
problems as Windows is because the system directories
-- /, /usr, /usr/lib, etc. -- are NOT writable by non-root users.
Combined with the general practice that you normally run as non-root,
and it becomes very difficult for a virus to change the *system*.
(Delete all of *your* files, sure, but it can't e.g. change /bin/bash
and then infect every other user on the system unless there's a local
root exploit as well.)

By loosening these permissions, you undermine this decades-old security
feature.  It's very bad.

Better would be to require installing by the root user, and then
changing the permission _on that particular .xml file_ so that everyone
can write to it (e.g. 666 permissions), leaving the directory
permissions unchanged.  This still isn't ideal -- it would allow
multiple users to change the file, potentially simultaneously (!), but
at least it won't open up the entire directory to attack.

&gt;<i> I will double check which libgdiplus.so it's trying to load, but I

</I>&gt;<i> them.  Will mono search the MONO_PREFIX/lib/ folder at runtime if it
</I>&gt;<i> can't find the libraries elsewhere?  Will it check that first? 
</I>
Are you setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH?  If LD_LIBRARY_PATH isn't set, then the
dynamic library loader will only look in /lib and /usr/lib (and other
directories; see /etc/ld.so.conf and ldconfig(8)).  Result: your version
of libgdiplus.so won't be loaded, the system-provided version will.
