Judging from Rafael's outline for the Mono namespace, it is about the same 
as the various Microsoft namespaces that exist in .NET (Microsoft.CSharp, 
etc.). At least for the MS namespaces, those exist separately (separate 
assemblies) from the core library, though they sometimes derive from corlib 
classes (CodeDomProvider for example).

&gt;<i>My suggestion of using &quot;OpenSystem&quot; instead of &quot;Mono&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>for such namespaces is intended to get other programmers

</I>
I have reservations about &quot;generic&quot;. Years ago I worked for a company that 
always wanted everything to be &quot;flexible&quot; (which basically is the same in 
this context). Outcome: yes, everything was flexible and didn't solve a 
specific problem. I tend to stick to &quot;make it work first, make it shiny later&quot;.

&gt;<i>I'm desperately trying to find some way that our two

</I>
Design bugs... in this case I'd say: perfectly ok design decision for Mono, 
given Mono would care only for itself (intentionally provocative).
