Well, the discussion we had last week on documentation was that we
should probably put the documentation offline from the main sources
because of the translation issues and the fact that editing and hacking
code that is fully documented can be confusing.

So documentation wise, this is what I would like to see:

	* Documentation kept on an external XML file.

	* A tool to edit and augment these XML files, and provide
	  sample code.

	* A tool to translate the documentation (and keep it again on
	  another external tool).

	* Extract any documentation we might have currently into these 	 
external files.

When it comes to API compatibility, if the ECMA and Microsoft APIs
differ, for now we should look for compatibility with the libraries as
released by Microsoft, not by ECMA or its profiles.  

Most people would be interested in Microsoft compatibility at this point
and not too much about ECMA.  Thinking about a process to support both
is something to keep in mind anyways.

Miguel.
