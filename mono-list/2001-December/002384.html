<PRE>Hey gang,

I talked to Miguel last night and got my cvs account. This morning, I
cleaned up some of the code, and committed it to CVS. It's now all in
corlib/System.Resources. I also added the whole namespace to the exclude
list in corlib.build, hopefully I did everything right and I didn't
break the build.

So far, I have most of the classes &quot;in there&quot;. All the interfaces,
exceptions and attributes are there, and they should be correct. I just
started looking into the ResX* classes, so those are the least developed
of all the classes I've checked in.

Of the Resource* classes (ResourceSet, ResourceManager, ResourceReader,
ResourceWriter), I think I have at least stubbed out all of the methods
and properties in the classes and when possible, also threw the correct
Exceptions. A lot of the implementation stuff still isn't there yet, but
the skeleton/framework is.

I know this is pretty bad, but yes, the code hasn't been checked AT ALL.
I have to take a final (exam) tomorrow, so I probably won't have time to
switch over to Windows and at least check the code for typos and other
stupid mistakes with csc. I'll be done with school after Wednesday, so
hopefully I'll have time to test the code before I leave for Hong Kong
(Christmas vacation)

If anyone is interested in contributing to the Mono, System.Resources
might be a good place to start. I, too, am a novice programmer, and I
would love to get some help to work out the namespace!

p.s. Thanks to Martin Weindel and Radek Doulik for helping me out.
