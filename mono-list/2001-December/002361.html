<PRE>Hi John,

Your approach sounds good.  In addition to adding OCL classes to Mono that
Mono does not define, do you plan to merge files that Mono does implement?
This would be useful to ensure the Mono signatures match the ECMA spec (and
you may get some implementation too).

OCL 0.2.0 could be your baseline for ECMA conformance.

We did the same kind of manual port when final draft ECMA XML library def
file was published.  We generated stubs using the final draft XML file, then
ported previous code to the new stubs so all the signatures in OCL 0.2.0
matched the final ECMA spec.

Regards,
Scott

Subject: [Mono-list] OCL/ECMA merging


Mono,

As soon as I manage to get Cygwin to trickle onto my laptop through this
soda straw of a dialup connection (I'm contracting onsite in Oklahoma, far
away from my friendly desktop box ;-), I'm planning on starting to
hand-merge the OCL generated C# stubs into the Mono class libraries.

A few points:

Intel's OCL build is released under a nice, friendly BSD-style license, and
I plan to include it somewhere in the mcs directory hierarchy with some
editorial notes as to its applicability.

I plan on altering the headers of each merged file to look something like
the following (I'll pick System.Collections.Hashtable as a purely random
example):

--- CUT ---
// System.Collections.Hashtable
//
// Authors:
//    Sergey Chaban (<A HREF="mailto:serge@wildwestsoftware.com">serge@wildwestsoftware.com</A>) (Implementation)
//    John Barnette (<A HREF="mailto:jbarn@httcb.net">jbarn@httcb.net</A>)            (OCL merges, cleanup)
//
// Copyright (c) 2001 Sergey Chaban
// Copyright (c) 2001 Intel Corporation.  All rights reserved.
//
// The signatures for this code were automatically generated from the
// standard ECMA CLI XML Library Specification. This class/interface/enum
// is a part of the ECMA CLI standard library specification.
--- CUT ---

I'll send the merged files to the list as diffs for any classes that I'm not
the maintainer for, but they'll likely be quite extensive, as a bit of
reformatting/cleanup will be part of the merging process.

I'm open to thoughts, suggestions, flames, and alternative processes for
this.
