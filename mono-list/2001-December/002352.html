I'd like to quietly disagree with that.  I'm a firm believer
in the idea that if you make programmers think generic,
they'll act generic.  Maybe I'm giving other programmers
too much credit.

Perhaps what is needed is the &quot;API Police&quot;, who go
through the system looking for examples of hard-wired
thinking and suggest changes?  And no, I don't want
that job, so don't take this as a volunteer offer.

Cheers,

Rhys.
