It does matter to me.  I don't believe you are giving enough
thought to making the code generic across implementations.

Naming things based on your own implementation enforces
a mode of thinking where no other project matters.  This will
quickly lead to &quot;Oh, just make a PInvoke call to monoblah.so
to get the implementation&quot;.  This isn't reusable.

Since Portable.NET is the &quot;designated other project&quot;, this
bugs me.  I'd like to reuse some of the upper-level Mono
libraries, but not if I have to rewrite them to remove
Mono-isms.

It's not a technical thing.  It's a mindset thing.  I only ask
that you think about the needs of other projects, especially
in the upper layers.

Cheers,

Rhys.
