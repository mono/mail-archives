<PRE>&gt;<i>From: Rodrigo Moya &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rodrigo@ximian.com">rodrigo@ximian.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i>* DataSet's: there's no such thing in libgda, but adding this is just a
</I>&gt;<i>matter of creating a new GObject class to libgda, since all the needed
</I>&gt;<i>stuff (XML for data transfer, offline, etc) is already available in
</I>&gt;<i>libgda or can easily be implemented.
</I>
Dataset are built as a quite separate layer above the rest of the classes in 
ADO.NET, and I think we should replicate this pattern not tying it directly 
to lidgda (ADO.NET Datasets use DataReaders to populate themselves and 
DataCommands to make them updatable).

&gt;<i>The only thing I think won't be easy to implement is read-write
</I>&gt;<i>datasets. That is, I can't imagine why somebody will get a picture of
</I>&gt;<i>an entire database, modify it for a day, for instance, and then put it back
</I>&gt;<i>to the database.
</I>
It´s not easy but it´s worth because it simplify enormously the application 
developer work. I know it firsthand because I have constructed thousands of 
forms/web pages with VB &amp; ADO, and it´s a lot easier to work with ADO.NET 
Datasets.

&gt;<i>This can be a nightmare if the database has been modified by other
</I>&gt;<i>people. But, well, it's not something impossible to
</I>&gt;<i>implement, so if it's needed, it can be added.
</I>
This nightmare comes if you don´t design properly your application...

If you need to guarantee consistency during a long-time &quot;user 
transaction/interaction&quot;, you MUST put locks to work.

My personal design rule is: if it takes less than a second use the 
appropriate transaction level to put the burden on the server to manage the 
locks, else if it takes more than a second (some batch processing, probably) 
or is interactive (where you can´t know how long will be the waiting time) 
use logical locks (especialized tables used as application´s internal 
semaphores).

&gt;<i>* XML: we are using custom XML formats for representing SQL queries
</I>&gt;<i>(XML queries we call them) and an entire database (GdaXmlDatabase), so 
</I>&gt;<i>maybe &gt;there can be a problem with this custom format if it is to be shared 
</I>&gt;<i>with other apps.
</I>&gt;<i>We were thinking on switching to the XML DTDs defined in
</I>&gt;<i><A HREF="http://www.odmg.org.">http://www.odmg.org.</A> Maybe we should support various formats for all
</I>&gt;<i>this?
</I>
First make these clearly an extension, keeping it on a Mono.Data namespace. 
Second make it pluggable: to our extended ADO.NET classes pass a 
Mono.Data.Query object that is a abstract class, not tied to XML, and derive 
a ODMGQuery class from it, because that way we can accept other dialects, 
and maybe even objects encapsulating W3C XQuery querys.

Happy Hackings
