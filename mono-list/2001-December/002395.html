</I>&gt;<i> yes, and it is a nice idea worth supporting it in gnome-db. I'm only
</I>&gt;<i> worried about the data loss that (I guess) users will encounter.
</I>
A very valid worry :)

&gt;<i> &gt; It's not necessarily a &quot;nightmare&quot; as you put it, because you can easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implement concurency techniques to avoid modifying any data that was changed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after you aquired your DataSet snapshot.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> yes, that's why I said it might be a nightmare, because users will be
</I>&gt;<i> losing their modifications too often (in a multi-user, ever-changing
</I>&gt;<i> database). As you say, it can be really easy to just discard
</I>&gt;<i> modifications for rows/fields that have already been changed by someone
</I>&gt;<i> else, but this won't help too much that user.
</I>
And this is all under the assumption that database items are pre-fetchable/cacheable
Which might not the case if you have triggers tied into those items.
Which means that the changes _need_ to be processed in the order they
were received.  Which sounds like it might make things even worse if you
just discard changes.

With that said. Isn't it just another tool? And you get to make a per-application
choice.

Cheers,
Carlos Jr.
