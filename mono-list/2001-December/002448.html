<PRE>Miguel,

|<i> I am not sure why NUnit would be catching those errors itself, it does
</I>|<i> not seem right.
</I>
I think that any exception not caught by a catch block in a test itself is
eventually caught by Nunit(Console/GUI).  For instance, the output of Nunit
for the UInt32Test.TestParse() is:

6) TestParse(MonoTests.System.UInt32Test): Exception of type
System.OverflowException was thrown.(System.OverflowException)
   at System.UInt32.Parse(String s) in
d:\cygwin\home\Administrator\mcs\class\corlib\System\UInt32.cs:line 84
   at MonoTests.System.UInt32Test.TestParse()

|<i> On the other hand, I have another problem right now: we are shipping
</I>|<i> binaries for NUnit and Nant, and they do not work right with the Release
</I>|<i> Candidate 0 (I have machines running with RC0 and Beta2), I think we
</I>|<i> should include the source code for Nant and Nunit with the package to
</I>|<i> avoid this problem, it would also be helpful to track the problems like
</I>|<i> this one down.  What do you think?
</I>
I think it's a good idea for NUnit at least.  I've been looking for a good
way to step through the code when a problem like this comes up, and the only
way to really see the whole picture is to have Nunit source too. Do you have
any tips for using VS.Net to track down a problem like this?  It's a pain
with the projects in VS.net because when you add sources from the mcs tree,
a copy is put in the VS.Net project directory, etc.

It's surprising, however that RC0 would affect the workings of Nant.  Are
there new SDK parts delivered with RC0?  I assumed it was just a new IDE and
the SDK remained at Beta 2.

Happy holidays,
Nick
