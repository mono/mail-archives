<PRE>
I'd like to know if there's a place I can find some &quot;getting started&quot; tips
for writing apps for both Windows and Mac (I suppose Linux, too, but that's
not a target platform).

Right now, I write in VB.NET for Windows. Someone is asking if I can develop
an app that will work on Windows and Macs, to which I quickly responded,
&quot;No.&quot; :oP  But, for kicks, I figured I'd look into it, and it appears that
it might not be too much of a pain to try mono. So my question is... what
exactly does it take to make an app for both Windows and Mac?

Do I have to use two different IDE's?

Do I have to do any &quot;conversion&quot; of the code after I'm done writing it on
the Windows platform?

What about the installer? I'm assuming that the VS.NET Setup and Deployment
project won't work on a Mac, so how do I create an installer for Macs
(especially one that will check to see if they have mono installed and tell
them to download it if they don't)?


This is my first foray into this type of thing, so talk real slow. :o)
