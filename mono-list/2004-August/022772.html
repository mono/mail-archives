&lt;P&gt;=0AHi friends...&lt;BR&gt;=0ATo be precise lemme tell you what behaviour am i =
facing.I have developed an ASP.NET application using C# and i want to run i=
t on RHL 9.0/Apache2.0 using mod_mono Mono 1.0.I have installed everything =
successfully(i guess so) from Daniel's notes step by step.Now if i run the =
same application under windows/IIS it runs PERFECT absolutely but when i ru=
n it under RHL 9.0/Apache 2.0/mod_mono/Mono 1.0, i get the weird behaviour.=
It run fine for some time...but after some time it seems that the connectio=
n to the server is lost if the application is left idle(probably 30 minutes=
).It starts giving the SERVER ERROR HTTP 500 for this particular applicatio=
n.If i try accessing the other directory under root i.e /mrtg that also wor=
ks fine but the problem is with this particular application only which use =
C# with mono run time.In order to fix that problem i need to restart the li=
nux box and everything starts running perfectly.I dont know what the proble=
m lies in and how to fix that up. I am using Session variables. I haven't c=
hecked the cookie settings on my Windows and redhat box, but I'd like to kn=
ow and change any setting that can run my web app without crashing. Any hel=
p or useful links will be of great help.I have checked out the error_log fi=
le and it says that [client 10.6.10.19] Directory index forbidden by rule: =
/var/www/html/. If i reboot the linux box now it will start working perfect=
ly without changing any permissions at all . btw the permission to the dire=
ctory where i have placed my app is 777 and its chowned by apache and group=
d is also apache.&lt;BR&gt;=0AAll the help will be highly appreciated.Somebody pl=
ease help...to figure out this behaviour.&lt;BR&gt;=0AAlso if you want to partici=
pate in more discussion in this topic...you may please be welcome to join a=
