<PRE>Hello, hello!

I have an aplication with many, many objects in memory that I have to
save/load to have persistence. I implemented an abstract framework that
enables me to make several persistence implementations. At this point, I
have implemented persistence in XML (I write, I read to DOM and parse --
can't use XmlSerializer cause I have some Hastables... :( ), and
implemented with the help of the BinaryFormatter. 

Before saving, I transform all my OO model in some simple classes that
contain only the necessary info to save/load. That's why I can apply a
BinaryFormatter easily.

I first tryed it in Microsoft .NET and found out that saving is much
more slower than loading... I wonder why! On the other hand, the same
test ou Mono/Linux got me that saving was faster than loading...

Now, I would like to understand the results, so I ask these questions:

1) Is writing to a file very much slower than reading from a file in
Windows? Does the oposite happens in Linux?

2) Any information on can add on this results? Are they &quot;expected&quot;
results?

Thanks.

Running on Microsoft .NET, I got this:
