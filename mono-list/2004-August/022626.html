I had dependency problems.  Running:

	sudo yum install monodoc

would install monodoc, but it wouldn't install (IIRC) mono-remoting,
mono-drawing, mono-web-forms, etc., so running monodoc after
installation would result in numerous error messages.

I installed it earlier this week, so 1.0.0 hasn't been fixed.  (Also,
this was a few days ago, so I may be forgetting the packages I had to
manually install.)  I imagine this is partially due to the shear
quantity of assemblies and packages needed for apps (mono-remoting,
mono-web-forms, mono-core, gtk-sharp, gtkhtml-sharp, etc., etc.), so
it's not surprising that some dependencies are missed.

Simple solution: install the mono-complete package.  This will pull in
all other packages, which should permit most apps to run.
