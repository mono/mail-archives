Hi,

&gt;<i> Yeah, Herb Schildt has two C# books out that I've seen, and both are bad.
</I>
&quot;If ever you want answers quick, then ask the expert&quot;.

The only problem is that this is the standard advertising blurb on his
books. Unfortunately as well, folks pay 30 UKP per book to find he is
*not* the expert.

&gt;<i> They both look like recycles of his Java books which were recycles of his
</I>&gt;<i> C++ books.  Very liitle effort was done to make these books .NET oriented=
</I>.

No. Very little effort was done.

&gt;<i> A shame, Herb wrote some good C/C++ books in the old days.
</I>
Can't say I've seen any of them. Probably the best book he wrote was the
annotated C standard whereby for 18UKP, you had a full copy of the
standard and could just ignore is largely incorrect comments on the
opposing pages!

Schildt is a dangerous author. Very dangerous.

TTFN

Paul
