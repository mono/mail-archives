Linspire is a repackaged Debian.

Consequently, the easiest way to get Mono on Linspire is to add the
Debian Unstable repository, and add the &quot;mono&quot; package.  (Debian Testing
has Mono 0.30, which is ancient, while Debian Unstable has Mono 1.0.1,
which is the current stable release.)

The easiest way to add Debian Unstable to Linspire is to edit (IIRC)
/etc/apt/apt.conf.  Google should help here.
