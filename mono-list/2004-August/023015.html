<PRE>Hello Pedro

I guess it depends on the country, for example here in Mexico, .NET is
still an unknown technology, even for those developers who use MS Windows,
I guess that maybe in two years everyone will be using .NET with mono,
(about the Linux community).

I can't tell you the best distribution for running mono, I only know that
it exists in almost all the Linux/Unix versions; migrating to mono's .NET
depends on the time which you will spent learning the mono environment
(and contributing) and the user's experience with Unix/Linux. I can't tell
you the best distribution for running mono, but I can tell you that mono
works pretty good with Debian using the deb packages.

Is mono a valid .NET development environment? Yes, it is.

Regards

&gt;<i> Hello, I am here to share my experience in the portuguese .NET
</I>&gt;<i> community. I have been a Mono user from version 0.3, and always have
</I>&gt;<i> talked about mono in my blog. In the last few days, I have been asked
</I>&gt;<i> several times on how to install Linux, what's the best distribuition to
</I>&gt;<i> install, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> This curiosity comes from Windows users that had never touched Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> Mainly VB .NET programmers, but also C# programmers, that question them
</I>&gt;<i> selfs if Mono is a valid .NET development environment, and want to try
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
&gt;<i> There where also some blog entries from the guys concerning the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of companies starting to use Mono and Linux, and they do not
</I>&gt;<i> want to be left behind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am curious about communitys from other countries, is this an isolated
</I>&gt;<i> case?
