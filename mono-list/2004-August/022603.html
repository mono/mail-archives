As long as the dependencies stay sane, I'm all for it. However, the
minute that mono (which now includes System.Drawing) depends on gdiplus,
which depends on cairo, etc, etc is when it gets nasty. I dont think
requiring X to install mono is sane. Personally, thats the advantage to
the current situation, and having 2 huge packages that have no proper
dependency info is a huge step back.

Why isnt is possible to create a 'mono' and 'mono-devel' package that is
basically a stub that deps on what would go in those. That way you get
the best of both worlds.
