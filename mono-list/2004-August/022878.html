<PRE>Hi all,

I'm looking for a good beginner C# book.  Preferably one that does not
assume a certain amount of familiarity with C++, Java, or OOP in
general.  I picked up &quot;Mono: A Developers Notebook&quot; from O'Reilly
figuring that some of the C++ I saw in school would come back to me.
What I saw in school was nearly five years ago and it's definitely not
coming back.

I really need a book that will not only go over the syntax and structure
of the language but the underlying fundementals of the language.  (Like
not just how to create a vector but what each part of the declaraion
means and how it all works.)  Right now I maintain the FreeBSD port for
Muine and I am looking at creating ports of other applications.  I would
like to have enough familiarity with the language to fix bugs,
especially FreeBSD specific bugs in programs.

If someone could recommend a book they found to give a good
comprehensive understanding of the language to a beginner that would be
great.  Thanks.

Tom
