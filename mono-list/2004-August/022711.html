<PRE>Regarding my previous issue with 500 errors - I complied all my .cs files
into individual .dll's and now I don't have issues.  Before I was
compiling into one .dll.  I'll get around to filing a bug report.  If you
want to try to duplicate, make a site with 2+ code behind pages (all code
in .cs), compile all .cs into one .dll, and try it.

Anyway, Now I'm having issues with authentication - as in it's not
happening.  I looked at the example for xsp, and even made my web.config
look just like the example (cp, edit, change login page filename, save). 
When I restart apache, and term all the mono's running, and access the
webpage, I  get right in to the default page, no login page.

Another thing that concerns me, is I have code in my Global.asax
Session_Start to do some session stuff.  I thought maybe sessions weren't
starting, so I threw in some code to return strings on the page.  Strings
get created on the page, but no session cookies appear in the browser.  My
browser (Firefox .9) is set to receive all cookies.

I've looked at the examples extensively, are there some configuration
options that I'm missing?

thanks,

Raul
