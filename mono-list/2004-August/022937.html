Yum on FC2 always bails out with dependency issues. I used Red Carpet
to get it.

Frankly, yum on Fedora is not easy enough for folks new to Linux, since
it requires a knowledge of yum and how to edit yum.conf. You can never
make it too easy, especially when you're trying to entice people to use
something.

Better to have one file that installs everything.  Package an rpm for
Fedora, an rpm for SUSE, etc. (And a tgz for Slackware would be really
nice, since I've switched back to my ol' friend Slack after playing with
Fedora and face the prospect of building it all from source.) That would
make it a two-click install:  one click to download, another click to
install. Also offer the individual pieces for folks who need to do it
their way.
