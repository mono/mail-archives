<PRE>Jo,

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> If they have their own package management system they control, isn't it 
</I>&gt;<i> Linspire's job then to package mono?
</I>
I would agree....  However, I was thinking that the mono team might approach
Linspire about it.  It was just a thought.  If one of the intents of the mono
project is make development on Linux easier, etc, then I think it might be nice
if it were available on a different distro.  I mean, it is already being
packaged for several distros, windows, and the mac now.
