<PRE>Yeah, Herb Schildt has two C# books out that I've seen, and both are bad.
They both look like recycles of his Java books which were recycles of his
C++ books.  Very liitle effort was done to make these books .NET oriented.
A shame, Herb wrote some good C/C++ books in the old days.

Hi,

&gt;<i> I picked up and started Sams &quot;C# Primer&quot;. It dates from 2001, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be taking a nice, slow, make-no-assumptions approach.
</I>
And if it's anything like the other SAMS books I've had the misfortune to
read, full of errors!

&gt;<i> Wrox books are full of obvious typoes, even in second editions and 
</I>&gt;<i> later. Who proofreads their stuff?
</I>
Dunno, but it can't be anywhere near as bad as Linux Games Programming from
Prima-Tech or *anything* Herb Shildt has done...

TTFN

Paul
