Hi Reilly.

&gt;<i> I've been experimenting with accessing a PostgreSQL database using Npgsql,
</I>&gt;<i> but have come across a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whenever I open a new NpgsqlConnection under the MS .NET runtime there is
</I>&gt;<i> always a short delay of a few seconds, presumably while the client
</I>&gt;<i> authenticates with the server. However, when the same program is run under
</I>&gt;<i> mono the delay is almost imperceptible. This is frustrating because I tend
</I>&gt;<i> to develop under VS.NET then distribute using mono.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm running mono 1.0.1 with Npgsql 0.6 and the server is PostgreSQL 7.4.3.
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried turning on logging support in Npgsql but it doesn't report
</I>&gt;<i> anything relevant: the log starts from when the connection is actually
</I>&gt;<i> established any everything works quickly after that. I've also tried
</I>&gt;<i> relaxing the authentication settings of the database but this has no effect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the cause of the problem might
</I>&gt;<i> be?
</I>&gt;<i>

Are you using the machine name as the address of server?
I received some reports about that only in ms.net as you said. I still 
didn't find why it would be doing this delay. I some time noticed that 
name resolution with ms.net took some time.
Please, try passing the ip address and let me know if you still have the 
problem.
