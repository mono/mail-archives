<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i>   Well, ok - I do know the benefits of the framework and the blah-blah
</I>&gt;<i> stuff. What I am more interested in some case studies that prove that
</I>&gt;<i> people are &quot;migrating&quot; to .Net/Mono in enterprise domain.
</I>
Well, am not sure if people are directly migrating from Java to
.NET/Mono, but folks are migrating from Win32/ASP to .NET based
programming.

&gt;<i>   Say, a company ABC may be pushing for .Net/Mono implementation of
</I>&gt;<i> their future works etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   As far as what I think, we lack a .Net version of Tomcat which will
</I>&gt;<i> allow the biggies as well as the masses to jump to .Net/Mono
</I>
What exactly is the role of Tomcat?

&gt;<i>   And unless we have a JerryMouse (nice name, huh!), there may be less
</I>&gt;<i> acceptance of .Net on a truly large scale. It's ok for a few
</I>&gt;<i> applications to be available on .Net (more for Windows) but then...
</I>&gt;<i> that's not what will be expected from a wonderful framework.
</I>
Well, different platforms have different strengths, so I would not be
surprised if people pick Java or .NET for different uses. 

&gt;<i>   I talked with Sanjay last week when I was at Novell, Bangalore and I
</I>&gt;<i> expressed my hunger for XSP's development and evolution as alternative
</I>&gt;<i> to Tomcat for the .Net/Mono platform.
</I>
You mean turning XSP into a full blown web server?  That might be nice,
and might be nice to implement some kind of hosting interface to host
web servers inside your application with ease.

Maybe .NET 2.x has some APIs to do that?

&gt;<i>   Is there any roadmap for XSP's evolution @Novell?
</I>
XSP has two parts:

	* The ASP.NET hosting.

	* The micro http 1.0 server.

The former is used by XSP and mod_mono (to run ASP.NET apps with
Apache), the later is only used in the standalone XSP. 

We will continue to update both, but the most important one is clearly
the one that is used by Apache, the standalone server is good to have,
but we are not planning on competing with Apache anytime soon.

That being said, some folks want to embed web servers in their apps
(yesterday we were discussing that, and thats why I wanted to look into
a possible .net 2.0 api that we would implement).

Miguel
