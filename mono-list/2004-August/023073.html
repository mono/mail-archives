The differences as I see them:

1) PyCs is sticking with C# (Cw) features where C# offers a choice.  So =
PyCs
is really going to be more of a dynamic C#.

2) PyCs is using dynamic type analysis instead of static type analysis.
This offers the advantage of *always* knowing the type where static =
analysis
is often unable to determine a type.  Evan an &quot;eval&quot; can't fool PyCs.

PyCs will compile a method when a type is determined.  This is akin to =
the
technique Psyco uses and I hope to see speed improvements over =
IronPython
because of this Psyco technique. =20

PyCs will have the Psyco disadvantage of memory usage in that there will =
be
a different method implementation for every combination of formal =
parameter
types (signatures) but this is exactly what C# does anyway.
