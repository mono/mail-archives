Mono/XSP works quite well in terms of separation of websites. The only
real bug I've experienced with mod_mono/XSP is corrected in 1.0.1. It
should be noted that this bug is in a feature I originally pestered
Gonzalo for (wildcards), so we're lucky to have it at all. :) 

Performance is not comparable to Win2003/IIS6.0 for the same ASP.net
code, obviously, but with both Mono (class libs, etc.) and XSP improving
all the time, this gap is quickly narrowing.

&gt;<i> 2. Does anyone know of ISPs offering mono right now?
</I>
Although we're not an ISP, we do provide Mono webhosting on our Linux
servers. Feel free to have a look at www.cityhost.ca. Also, we offer
free hosting, service, and support for open source projects
(particularly any with a relation to Mono).
