</I>Hopefully MonoDevelop combined with mono-debugger can turn out to be 
just as productive as Visual Studio .NET. I haven't tried it yet, since 
mono-debugger isn't packaged for Debian.

An easy-to-use IDE with a handy debugging interface is what's needed to 
attract developers to GNU/Linux IMHO. Mono is already a big leap 
forward. Before, programmers probably had to use C/C++ if they wanted to 
develop an (integrated) application for GNU/Linux, which isn't as 
attractive as developing in C#.

Kind regards,
