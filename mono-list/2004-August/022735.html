<PRE>We have started doing the daily builds and uploading the packages again,
since last week. But havent started the test execution part yet.

Thanks,
Sudha.

</I>While running test cases after daily builds in different distros, many
test cases hang in between and lot of manual intervention is required
to
kill the hanging process and start it again. The document attached
contains the details of test cases that hang. These are based on the
observations of past two weeks. 
Appreciate if you can take a look into it and help in fixing them -
problem may be in NUnit/mcs/respective component.

We will be focusing on other QA tasks like adding missing test cases
for VB, developing robust framework for ADO.NET..  in coming 1 month.
We
will not be doing daily builds and test case execution during this
time.

Hope to fix test case hang problem in the mean time.
Volunteers appreciated.

Thanks
Manjula
