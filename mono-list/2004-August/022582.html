<PRE>&gt;<i> Dave,
</I>&gt;<i> I will take a look at doing this since I am pretty familiar with the
</I>Visual
&gt;<i> C++ project files.
</I>
Thanks so much for taking a look at doing this, Nathan. I appreciate it very
much and I am sure there are others in the same situation as me who would
also appreciate it greatly :-)

&gt;<i> Boy I can't wait for MSBuild though :-)
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, maybe I should just do it in MSBuild?  Would you mind downloading
</I>&gt;<i> the MSBuild beta to use the files?  Or would a VC++ project file be
</I>better?

I am not familiar with MSBuild, but I have a fast connection so downloads
are not a problem, and at this point, I'm willing to try just about anything
:<i>-). So if you'd prefer to use MSBuild that's fine with me, just give me a
</I>URL where I can download it.

&gt;<i> I cannot guarantee that I would have time to keep it up to date, but I
</I>could
&gt;<i> get the current release converted at least.  At least I can try.
</I>
I think that once someone is brave enough to tackle making the first version
like you, it will be much easier for others to step in later and maintain
the already existing version.(for instance, I would be willing to do this)
So I don't think there should be a worry that you will have to be a one man
show maintaing this or anything!

&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i> Nathan Neitzke
</I>&gt;<i> Embry Riddle Aeronautical University
</I>&gt;<i> Independent Software Consultant
</I>
So once again, thanks for looking into this Nathan, I really appreciate it!
If needed, you can contact me directly at <A HREF="mailto:daveb@shaw.ca.">daveb@shaw.ca.</A> Also I will try to
keep checking the mailing list multiple times per day.

Sincerely,
Dave B.
