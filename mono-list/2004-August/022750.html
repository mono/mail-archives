</I>Craig:

Building the core Mono components like the Runtime and/or the C# 
compiler (mcs.exe) from Windows is not for everyone.  Today the Win32 
version of Mono are built using cygwin.  The build process is a moving 
target as well -- this has more to do with the dynamic nature of cygwin 
and its packages.

All of the installer for windows that I have put together to this date 
have basically assemble and extended the binary Mono components that 
have resulted from the efforts of Novell employee's compilation of Mono 
for Windows.  By the way, today there is only one official builder of 
Mono for Windows at Novell and he is a dedicated resource on other areas 
of Mono functionality.

If you are just getting started with Mono on Windows I would suggest you 
build applications using Mono rather than trying to build Mono itself.
