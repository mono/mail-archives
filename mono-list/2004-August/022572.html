<PRE>Joe,
  You are not alone.  Even on stock builds of Linux there are many conflicts
and problems.  If you load anything outside of the base product.  Your
suggestion of putting the working dll's in a zip or installer would work the
same as my suggestion to move all the libraries in one directory on Linux
and set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the appropriate place to pick everything up.
This would allow users to work with little or no effort.  Now I'm sure
someone will flame me for this but no one including the originator of the
project has explained to me why a 1.0 product does not load with libraries
and environments of supported distributions (i.e. Suse , RedHat etc.)
without major hassles.  It seems there is a lot of work to do on getting
shrink wrapped versions
Of major distributions ( Windows XP is one ) to work with the full mono.

HI,

After trying to build mono on windows for 2 days using the help of a unix
guy, it still doesn=B9t work.
I tried everything from the windows build scripts to the
www.nullenvoid.com/wiki intro how to manually compile mono. To just trying
to figure out the error msgs myself.
I am getting problems like GCC hanging in monoburg.c, but mostly just
pkgconfig not finding libraries.

I am desperate now.
Does anyone have a built mono install which includes the dll's and librarie=
s needed for embedding mono and wants to send it over?

Or what if someone smart would just put the dll's into the windows
installer, wouldn=B9t that be like real cute.

Joachim Ante
