<PRE>I am interested in compiling mono with Microsoft Visual C++. Specifically, I
want to be able to compile the samples/embed tests.
This would require one of two things:
a) Precompiled Libs to link with.
b) A Visual Studio project file that would allow me to compile the said
libs.

Neither of which is available in the 2 windows distributions(source, binary
installer).

Could anyone point me to a solution (no pun intended) to my problem?
Another less favorable option might be to modify the makefile so I can build
a visual studio compatible libmono.dll/libmono.lib pair with gcc on cygwin.
However I have no knowledge of how to do this. Any help would be greatly
appreciated!

BTW, before posting this message I did an extensive search of the message
database looking for similar questions. The most promising was this:
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-May/005432.html">http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-May/005432.html</A>
And I have sent the author an e-mail. However, since that was 27 months ago,
I hold little hope for a reply.

Thanks for reading this message. Here's hoping that someone out there has
the answer!
Sincerely,
Dave B.
