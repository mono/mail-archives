<PRE>Hi,

  How beneficial is .Net over Java at enterprise level?

  Well, ok - I do know the benefits of the framework and the blah-blah
stuff. What I am more interested in some case studies that prove that
people are &quot;migrating&quot; to .Net/Mono in enterprise domain.

  Say, a company ABC may be pushing for .Net/Mono implementation of
their future works etc.

  As far as what I think, we lack a .Net version of Tomcat which will
allow the biggies as well as the masses to jump to .Net/Mono

  But again, I may be wrong in saying that a .Net Tomcat is being
sought after - there may be one available.

  And unless we have a JerryMouse (nice name, huh!), there may be less
acceptance of .Net on a truly large scale. It's ok for a few
applications to be available on .Net (more for Windows) but then...
that's not what will be expected from a wonderful framework.


Miguel / Gonzalo,

  I talked with Sanjay last week when I was at Novell, Bangalore and I
expressed my hunger for XSP's development and evolution as alternative
to Tomcat for the .Net/Mono platform.

  Is there any roadmap for XSP's evolution @Novell?

  Are there any plans to involve Apache in XSP's evolution? ...similar
to what was done to Tomcat


Happy Hacking,
Gaurav Vaish
