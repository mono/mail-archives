I think you may be able to set an attribute and serialize hashtables on
your own. Google should have more details.

Writing is usually slower than reading, but this is not likely the cause
of the behaviour you're seeing.

Mono 1.0 was released more than a month ago, please use that.

The results look interesting, especially if they were run on the same
machine as the MS .net ones:-)
There is probably some method or algorithm involved in the load path
that needs to be optimized in mono. You could use a smaller data set
(to reduce test time) and run the load test with:
	mono --profile test-load.exe ...

The profile should give you some hints about where it's spending the
time. You might want to post the relevant info to the list, so whatever
in mono is causing the slowdown on load can be fixed.
