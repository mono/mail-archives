<PRE>Duncan Mak said the following on 24/08/2004 19.58:

&gt;<i>Hello all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Hello Duncan,

&gt;<i>Is Mono too difficult to install for people new to Linux? For people
</I>&gt;<i>with Linux experience?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I'm new to Linux and, yes, it is hard. It was hard installing a clean 
SuSE box, it's still hard work with the new environment (I come, 
obviously, from Win) for a thousand reasons and, finally, it is hard to 
install and configure Mono. I feel myself a skilled user, as a 
programmer but under Linux I find myseld kinda lost :!

I believe the hardest thing about Mono is correctly configure mod_mono, 
apache &amp; co.

As you said, many developers are trying to move to Mono and so, to 
Linux. Probably good tutes about the prerequisites would help (eg: I 
didn't know nothing about &quot;make + make install&quot; before swimming around 
the Net, and that's like breath for a normal Linux user).. don't know, 
something like driving directions for the first weeks :) .. or just &quot;for 
Windows users FAQ&quot;, where a Win user can find how to work with basic 
settings (also an environment variable could cost us half a day trying 
to understand).

I don't know the technical reasons, but probably if Red Carpet installs 
also mod_mono that could help a lot.
