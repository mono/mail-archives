<PRE>Hi,

I'm asked by my manager to install Mono on our Intranet server, to run an=
 eLearning package.
However, the compilation process ended up with a few error messages, and=
 Mono won't install.

I've looked around (newsgroups, google, mailing list archives, etc), and it=
 seems that not many people are installing Mono in this particular platform=
 (or they didn't encounter any problem at all). So I'm still clueless on=
 why Mono won't install here.

Here's the notes that I made during the installation :

#Mono installation notes

#ASSUMPTIONS:

#[1] Platform : Solaris 8, SPARC
#[2] The following packages already installed: gcc &gt;=3D 3.4.1, make, flex,=
 libiconv

Here's the error messages showed up after executing make :

The following happened 6 times, on the following files :

The following shows the end of make process:

A bit weird because there's no error on the compilation itself (just a few=
 warnings), but make ended up with errors (and &quot;make install&quot; won't run)

Here's a few notes showed up after running configure :
Might be irrelevant though (just a few warnings)

I noted that gcc is running with &quot;pthreads&quot; option. I read in gcc v3.4.1=
 notes that we shoudl replace pthreads with posix

configure: running /bin/bash './configure' --prefix=3D/bcc/mono-1.0=
  '--prefix=3D/bcc/mono-1.0' 'CC=3D/usr/local/bin/gcc'=
 --disable-embed-check --with-libgc-threads=3Dpthreads=
 --cache-file=3D/dev/null --srcdir=3D.

Hopefully someone on this list would be able to assist me with this.


Many thanks,
Harry
