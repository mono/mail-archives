 That was Phalanger version 1.0. In my first post I had said that with 2.0 Phalanger is 100% C# and the Phalanger people have stated that theoretically it will work seamlessly on Mono. And that's the reason why I tried it on Linux, and got a missing URI error, and I first made the complaint on the Phalanger list, where they told me it was a missing method inside Mono, and not an issue with Phalanger per se, and that a pure dotnet application written in Phalanger should work transparently on Mono and windows.

 Thanks.
