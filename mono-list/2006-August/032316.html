No matter how Phalanger is important for you, it is just one of
applications from the point of a managed runtime's view.

&gt;<i>  Anyway, I had only tried the stable version. I will try with the 
</I> &gt;&#12288;CVS one. I find the sheer size of mono a bit daunting though, but
 &gt; I think it should worth the effort. Anyway, my initial question was
 &gt; whether there will be OFFICIAL support for phalanger in mono, just
 &gt; like you have for IronPython. Maybe the style of my Original Post
 &gt; was a bit convoluted, and my question wasn't clear I guess, but what
 &gt; I had meant to ask was the Official position of Mono team vis-a-vis
 &gt; Phalanger.

AFAIK We don't support IronPython OFFICIALLY. Some of us made changes
for it just because they probably wanted. When they lost their interest,
it would be left away. If you want Phalanger on Mono and there are
missing bits, we'd welcome your patches to fix the issues (it happens
with related to many applications such as Nemerle and Boo).

Or if you are asking about commercial support (it could be said as
&quot;official&quot;), there is Mono Developer Support from Novell:
