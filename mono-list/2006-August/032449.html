<PRE>Hello,

    In the next couple of days, I will remove mbas, the Visual Basic
runtime and the various other incomplete forks of mbas that we have on
the mcs tree from the tree as they are outdated, no longer under
development, unmaintained and buggy.

    We will replace this with two new components:

* Mainsosft's new fresh VB runtime.

This fresh VB runtime was written by Rafael Mizrahi and Boris Kirzner
completely in VB.NET.   The code also contains two extensive test
suites: a C# based test suite for low-level components and it consumes
plenty of VB tests from the current runtime, compilers and the new vbc
from Rolf Bjarne.

* Rolf's VB.NET compiler written in VB.NET.   

Rolf Bjarne has been working on a VB.NET 9 compiler written in VB.NET
itself, which is a very good test for the qualities of his compiler.

This compiler is very close to bootstrapping and it is also able to
build these new class libraries (it can compile itself, and is missing
one tiny feature: embedding resources, to be self-hosting)

Rolf effort is partially funded by Google Summer of Code program.

Miguel.
</PRE>
