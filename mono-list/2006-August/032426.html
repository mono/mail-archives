</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>That's what I just said, except in the other order. It's this concern that
I'm concerned about.

</I>I'm not surprised that the naming doesn't concern you much. You're the Mono
project lead, of course a little naming oopsie isn't going to affect your
immediate work. But if you were a developer or user, you'd be concerned.
You'd be worried about whether or not 3.5 onward is going to depend on 3,
because if you recall COM (and virtaully all .NET libraries) versioning
rules, even if the numbers aren't incremental, they are in order, and the
higher includes the lower.

And again, yes, Mono is useful even though certain things are missing, but
not surprisingly, these components also happen to be ones that I don't use
much either, even though I spend most of my time using the original .NET
implementation on Windows. That won't be true this time around.

I don't feel any better then.

&gt;<i>From a developer standpoint as well as an end-user standpoint, I don't know
</I>whether I'm supposed to expect .NET to have much of a future outside
Windows, in part or in whole. Until the answer to whether or not WinFX will
be implemented on Mono is a &quot;yes&quot;, I never will know.

Sure the sky isn't falling (yet), but do you think I'm the only one that
gets the impression that it might?

If things like LinQ aren't reliant on 3.0, then show that in the name for
God's sake! If you haven't noticed yet, that's what I'm petitioning for.

</I>Exactly, and that's what I'm &quot;freaking out&quot; about.
