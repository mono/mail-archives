<PRE>I am not on the Mono-dev team, so my opinion doesn't really matter that
much, but ...

PHP is first and furthermost *a platform*, not a language.
People use PHP because of mod_php and Apache, not because of the way you
construct strings ... which I think it is a stupid assumption.
People use PHP because it is very *cheap* to have an Apache server with
mod_php installed. Period.

People *do not* use PHP because it is a beautiful language ... in fact
it has lots and lots of problems, which you obviously seem to not know
about and/or ignore.

Both Python and PHP are languages defined by their implementations,
since they are not standardized. They play the role of wrappers for C
libraries ... they where designed for this. That's the main reason
Jython, IronPython, Phalanger, or whatever ... will never be used
outside a very small niche.

And btw ... Python is a lot more mature and complete. Python is fully
object-oriented. Python is general-purpose. Python is used for many
mission-critical applications ... so lets not compare apples to oranges
here, and bash a language because the string construction doesn't feel
right ... which I think it is very shortsighted  ;)

About MONO's support ... I am sorry to hear that Phalanger doesn't work
on Mono. I really do. But considering that many other languages run on
top of Mono, I think you should be talking firstly with the Phalanger's
dev team, because I am under the impression they didn't really try.

And btw ... the &quot;P&quot; in LAMP is primarily for Perl ;)


PS: don't get offended by my tone. I just woke up, and I'm incapable of
civilized conversations in the morning :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  No no.. That's not a correct attitude, especially since Phalanger is not just 'another application'. Having Phalanger would be very advantageous for Mono, since it is actually the most mature non-microsoft compiler I know of. PHP is the simplest and most popular language out there for web, and I am still not able to understand how you can dismiss it offhand. Or you mean you have no interest in reaching the millions of php developers out there? You are primarily a platform vendor, and your focus is developers. With phalanger you get a ready made team of millions of skilled and semi-skilled php coders, and even the people who are new to web, and whose first language of choice is PHP. I mean, I am totally at a loss as to how to make sense of your attitude.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  From my discussion with Phalanger people, I did realize that their primary focus was the Windows platform, but they were ready to co-operate in any effort to make it work on Mono--at least they were not dismissive of Mono like you are of Phalanger.
