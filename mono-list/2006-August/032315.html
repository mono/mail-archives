 PHalanger is not just another '[insert your app name]' application. It is a framework which, if it works properly can actually help get more people into Mono. Php is the most used language, especially in the internet, and having an ability to code in DotNet using php should be an attractive feature. Python has severe drawbacks when it comes to web programming--the space indentation, lack of '$', and the inability to embed variables into strings to name a few--and since dotnet is primarily meant to a web development platform, having php in the mix seems like the right idea to me.

 Anyway, I had only tried the stable version. I will try with the CVS one. I find the sheer size of mono a bit daunting though, but I think it should worth the effort. Anyway, my initial question was whether there will be OFFICIAL support for phalanger in mono, just like you have for IronPython. Maybe the style of my Original Post was a bit convoluted, and my question wasn't clear I guess, but what I had meant to ask was the Official position of Mono team vis-a-vis Phalanger.

 Thanks.
