Implement a SOAP extension:

I'm not sure why you need it, but here is it:

<A HREF="http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/trunk/mcs/class/corlib/System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary/binary_serialization_format.htm?rev=27351&amp;view=log">http://svn.myrealbox.com/viewcvs/trunk/mcs/class/corlib/System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary/binary_serialization_format.htm?rev=27351&amp;view=log</A>

&gt;<i> does the work i need to do except that it puts some extra stuff into the

</I>&gt;<i> pull out the bytes between the markers to get the appropriately formatted
</I>&gt;<i> bytes for the packet i need to send. Obviously, this is a brittle solution.
</I>&gt;<i> If i had the format the binary serializer uses, then i could extract

</I>&gt;<i> a better way. Even better, if i had an API that allowed me to extract
</I>&gt;<i> naturally distinct pieces, e.g. just member data, excluding class name or
</I>&gt;<i> member name data or even size information, then i could have a very robust
</I>&gt;<i> and generic application.
</I>
Such an API doesn't make sense, unless it's intended to be used
by non-CLI languages (C/C++...).

You should implement a custom formatter, if you need this level of
control.

If you want to intercept remoting calls, you could insert a
custom server channel sink after the formatter sink and you'll
be able to access the remoting messages before they get dispatched.
