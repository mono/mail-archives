A true point: I was only thinking of the official Mono installer for  
Windows. A manual compile or xcopy-based installation would not be  
detected that way, but then again if a user was able to do so (s)he  
will be able to fiddle around with the shortcuts to adapt them to the  
installation directory.

A last resort might be to do a full MSI based search for mono.exe on  
the complete system...
But then again I would need to provide a selection UI similar to  
those for browser plugins to handle the case of an application-local,  
limited installation as in Bill's case.

P.S. Talking of Mono on Windows, does anyone have an update of Mono  
on Win9x/ME? That's another unanswered question of mine... (and if  
working again would lead to a non-official installation!)
