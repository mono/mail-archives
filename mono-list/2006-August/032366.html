Of course!
Like any non trivial piece of software depending on any non trivial
API, ASP.NET already *is* patent-tied, there's no need to wait for
it to &quot;become&quot; so...

Sorry, could not resist ;-)
Software patents are just so evil, they irritate me.

Anyway, if MS wanted to *try* to hurt Mono badly, they could just as
well start a patent war on GTK#, using some kind of GUI or graphics
related patent (which btw would also affect GTK and therefore Gnome
as a whole, Mono would likely be out of the equation).
I say &quot;try&quot; because starting a patent war like that would be... well,
let's just say that nobody would like it IMHO, *including* MS.

But these things have been said and repeated millions of times...
If anybody wants to be frozen by the fear of software patents, ok,
go ahead and stop writing code completely.
Just don't say it's a problem peculiar to ASP.NET and MS: it's not.

Ciao,
  Massi
