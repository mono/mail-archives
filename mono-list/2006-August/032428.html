that to Microsoft. Or, that would no doubt be the perception to say the
least.

You work with people who know Mono inside out. But believe me, it really
isn't good for Mono for there to be more unimplemented .NET components. It
just makes both .NET and Mono look flimsy, and certainly as that becomes the
case, Microsoft's devs will become more and more careless as well.



&gt;<i> As with any other open source project, if you need something that is not

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion is to stay on the safe side and use Mono implemented APIs,
</I>&gt;<i> and even the Mono stack.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>I know, although I don't think anyone has the resources or energy to
implement anything more than a quick hack most of the time.

In any case, thanks for taking the time to chat. I'm still not convinced
that the name switch is a good move, and it doesn't seem like you disagree
with me on that, seeing that you seem to agree with me for the most part,
intentionally or not.

By the way, if you don't mind me breaking the mailing list etiquette a
little (I bet it's there for this exact reason), great work on Mono. I love
watching it grow and become more and more useful.
