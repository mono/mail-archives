Did you check Phalanger's FAQ?

# Is it possible to use Phalanger under Mono?

No, it is currently not possible because some parts of Phalanger are 
mixed assemblies written in Managed C++, which is not supported in Mono. 
Although we are planning on rewriting these components to C++/CLI as we 
switch to FW 2.0, one of them - the Extension Manager - will always 
contain some native code. So it is likely that Phalanger will run under 
Mono in the future but without the Extension Manager. However, if Mono 
supports C++/CLI in the future we would probably port the Extension 
Manager to Mono.

You should rather ask Phalanger's team for &quot;official&quot; Mono support.
