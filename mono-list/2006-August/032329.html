 No no.. That's not a correct attitude, especially since Phalanger is not just 'another application'. Having Phalanger would be very advantageous for Mono, since it is actually the most mature non-microsoft compiler I know of. PHP is the simplest and most popular language out there for web, and I am still not able to understand how you can dismiss it offhand. Or you mean you have no interest in reaching the millions of php developers out there? You are primarily a platform vendor, and your focus is developers. With phalanger you get a ready made team of millions of skilled and semi-skilled php coders, and even the people who are new to web, and whose first language of choice is PHP. I mean, I am totally at a loss as to how to make sense of your attitude.


 From my discussion with Phalanger people, I did realize that their primary focus was the Windows platform, but they were ready to co-operate in any effort to make it work on Mono--at least they were not dismissive of Mono like you are of Phalanger.
