<PRE>I'm a Windows .Net desktop application developer at work and a Linux 
user at home.

I've been lurking on this list for several years and fiddled with Mono 
and Mono Develop once and a while to see how it's coming along. It gets 
better each time I revisit a project, but I'm usually forced to drop the 
GUI and start over each time. I'm probably just taking too long to keep 
up with changes in Stetic.

However, my decision to wait around isn't because I see Mono and Mono 
Develop as a toy. I've seen enormous progress since I started watching 
and hope one day soon things will stabilize enough that I'll be able to 
work part time on a project without rebuilding the GUI from scratch. 
Until then, it won't be &quot;time for me yet&quot; either.

I know that I'll eventually be building cross platform .Net applications 
&quot;at work&quot; as well as &quot;at home&quot; using Mono. I wonder how many of us are 
lurking? :-)
