<PRE>Hi Miguel,
 
Amusing but true. :-)
 
I am thinking about how to foster adoption of new NUnit versions more
quickly under Mono. Trying to list the obstacles, I come up with the
following - you may add or correct me, of course.
 
1. NUnit is used as both a build tool for Mono itself and as an tool for
   developers creating applications under Mono. Up to now, I think
   we have failed to treat these two uses as distinct problems, possibly
   calling for distinct solutions.
 
2. The NUnit team doesn't provide a decent install for NUnit on Linux.
 
3. The expectations of developers about how multiple versions of
    NUnit should co-exist on Linux and Windows are somewhat
    different. In Windows, it's all xcopy deployment without use
    of the GAC. In Linux, Mono apps seem to be placed in the
    GAC quite freely - my observation, anyway - and placed
    there in a way that makes side-by-side installation difficult.
    [I don't think the last is a technical issue, but rather one
    of different communities expecting different things to work.]
 
4. Depending on how you get a binary install of Mono, NUnit
    may come with it or may be a separate package. Separate
    packaging would make updates easier.
 
5. The Mono coding standards for tests encourage use of
    techniques that pre-date NUnit 2.0. Some of the methods
    used have been marked obsolete for many years and 
    are disappearing in the next NUnit release.
 
Feel free to correct me and/or add to this. Next, I'd like to
think about solutions.
 
Charlie

Hello, 

Is it ok to submit patches to mono that depend on the latest version of
NUnit?


As long as the resulting code *builds* you can.  

So I think this means &quot;no&quot;.

Miguel.

You are confused;   There are no changes, you should just not depend on
Mono's built-in and private copy of NUnit to write your NUnit test
cases.

You should get the latest NUnit.
