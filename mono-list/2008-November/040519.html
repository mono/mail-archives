<PRE>Hi Andreas,

Ah! Thanks.

&gt;<i> And to summarise your response, it's only about the command(s), i.e.

I think that's it. Originally, I was dubious about the whole issue
of bundling NUnit with Mono. But even though it doesn't make a lot
of sense to me, it really doesn't cause a problem so long as
it's the same as the corresponding upstream version and is 
more or less &quot;hidden&quot; under /usr/lib/mono.

I'll put something in Bugilla about this now that we've
aired the issue a bit.

&gt;<i> What packages Linux distributions actually make of it 
</I>&gt;<i> (whether/how they package and ship Mono's private NUnit) 
</I>&gt;<i> would probably be better aired as a request on the new 
</I>&gt;<i> mono-packagers-list.
</I>
Hmmm... I'll look at that list. But oddly, part of my 
concern here is that the Mono distribution alone is acting
as sort of packager for NUnit. One of the things that has
really attracted me to Linux is the distinction between
upstream developers and packagers. In a way, by packaging
NUnit with Mono, the Mono guys are acting more like what
I've seen in the Windows world. ;-)
