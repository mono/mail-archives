The difference is that the latter sounds incredibly dismissive (&quot;those
guys over there doing their thing nobody cares about&quot;) vs constructive
(&quot;something useful but not for me right at the moment&quot;).  It may not
seem like a huge difference, but one borders on trolling and the other
doesn't.  I'm open to other peoples' interpretations on this.

Not trying to hijack the thread, I promise.  :)

&gt;<i> If I'm going to create and modify winforms using Visual Studio and .NET,

</I>
Running finished products in itself is quite an accomplishment given
the complexity and size of something like the CLI and .NET framework.
Again, it may not be useful to you, but don't knock it.

&gt;<i> But I'm hopeful.  That's why I hang around.  I want to look into the Gtk# on
</I>&gt;<i> Windows idea, too.  Depending on what's required to make it work, that sounds
</I>&gt;<i> interesting as well.
</I>
In my own experience, using the Medsphere Gtk# runtime packages is
pretty much all you need to get your stuff running on Windows.  I've
had pretty good luck with it too.
