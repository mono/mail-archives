Greetings,

I've spent last night trying to putting the mono running smoothly on my web
server.

The scenario is as follows: It's a remote machine with centOs installed, I
have lot's of virtual hosts and I am using CPanel.

Well... I managed to put mono working only in specific accounts as I
desired, but there are some things that are not as I wished.

I am such a noob in this so let me see if I understood, to set MonoMaxMemory
and MonoMAxCPUTime it must be to a specific application?


1   LoadModule mono_module modules/mod_mono.so
2   Alias /jeanette &quot;/home/jeanette/web&quot;
3   AddMonoApplications jeanette &quot;/jeanette:/home/jeanette/web&quot;
4   MonoMaxMemory jeanette 200000000
5   MonoMaxCPUTime jeanette 3600
6   &lt;Location /jeanette&gt;
7       MonoSetServerAlias jeanette
8       SetHandler mono
9   &lt;/Location&gt;


I can't do this for the whole server???

Other thing I noticed, I used a test page to test mono and it worked fine...
I developed then a webpage in asp.net (a simple one like hello world) and I
did publish, this way it will generate some dll, and web.config, etc
I just copied the result to my website and it says:

Server Error in '/' Application

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: An application error occurred on the server. The current custom
error settings for this application prevent the details of the application
error from being viewed remotely (for security reasons). It could, however,
be viewed by browsers running on the local server machine.

Details: To enable the details of this specific error message to be viewable
on remote machines, please create a &lt;customErrors&gt; tag within a &quot;web.config&quot;
configuration file located in the root directory of the current web
application. This &lt;customErrors&gt; tag should then have its &quot;mode&quot; attribute
set to &quot;Off&quot;.


I tryed to put the web.config as it says but there was no way he could show
me something :(
I can't understand what is the error? does the mono suport dlls for
webpages? what is the problem?

Thanks for your attention but I'm getting desesperated
