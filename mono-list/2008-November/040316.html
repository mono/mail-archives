Hi!

I'm quite frustrated: I use Debian (not the supported Suse or Redhat or
Windows stuff) and don't want debian packaged Mono either. I want the most
recent official version.

I used to grab the generic installer from 
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Other_Downloads">http://www.mono-project.com/Other_Downloads</A>
but it is still 1.9.1_2

Why has it not been updated?

I usually install it to /opt, tell it to leave my environment alone and then
strip it manually down to 10mb which I need for my purpose.

I would really like to get hold of the official binaries (I don't want to
compile it myself, that might introduce bugs from my libarries or other
problems). 

I don't actually need the installer btw. Just a tgz file of the binary raw
contents would be great.

If I go to the mono homepage and try to download something for Suse or
redhat, that leads me nowhere! I just get told to use the buildin update
managers, etc. BAH! No possibility of downloading one large RPM and just
extracing it and using the good fine binaries directly. (for the windows
version (one big isntaller) that woudl be easy)

And how would I be sure that I really get the most recent official 2.1
release that way???

I'm pretty frustrated with the way the mono system &quot;supports&quot; the distros. I
mean it's great that mono gets good integration into distros, but I would
certainly prefer MUCH LESS integration.

Can anyone trigger the person who builds the generic Linux updater?

Why did it stop to be updated?
