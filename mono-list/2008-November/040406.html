Hi There,

We have been tasked with creating a piece of software that will allow the
user to backup their local files to a server in the data centre.

Originally we had planned to develop it in .NET and use WSE 3.0 with MOTM to
handle the file uploads.  Being the project manager and not one of the
developers I am not advanced in my technical knowledge but my understanding
of the benefits of this is that this method gives us a good level of
security as encrytption is handled automatically when MOTM is enabled on the
webservice and the client.

This week our client has requested that the application also be available on
linux and mac.  This is why we are now looking at MONO.  Our immediate
problem is that WSE 3.0 and MOTM is not supported by MONO.

&gt;<i>From reading the website there is a project called OLIVE that will be an
</I>alternative to WSE 3.0 but is in an early experimental stage.

I would really appreciate it if anyone could tell me if it if possible to
create a secure and stable file upload program in MONO.  If so how would be
best to go about this?

Many thanks for your help &amp; advice.

Regards,

Mike
