At the risk of perpetuating a not-very-useful thread, one might ask what's the 
difference between &quot;not seriously considering using mono professionally&quot; and 
&quot;reduced to a toy/hobby/not-serious project&quot;?

I'm planning on considering using mono professionally, even if only for 
development utilities (our commercial products require Windows).  But it's not 
there for me yet, as it's just too much trouble to use for developing portable 
winform applications.  

If I'm going to create and modify winforms using Visual Studio and .NET, 
what's the point in using mono for anything, other than running the finished 
products?

But I'm hopeful.  That's why I hang around.  I want to look into the Gtk# on 
Windows idea, too.  Depending on what's required to make it work, that sounds 
interesting as well.
