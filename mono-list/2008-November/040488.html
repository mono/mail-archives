Oh I blindly thought they do (like I do), since it requires every nunit
dll in use either in the GAC or copied locally (and copying them locally
is messy). You are right at the point that the installer does not
install those dlls in the GAC, and that is not what I intended.

We can't? I guess no, and hence I assume there's no real problem.
As you would already know, there was no code change in the outcome
assemblies.

We cannot cure people's confusion while we are doing the right stuff.
Or I may be misunderstanding you on what causes some people(?)
get confused.

</I>
If there's reasonable reason people get confused because of my
interpretation or effort on upgrading nunit version, then I feel
sorry ;)
