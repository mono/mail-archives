Are there any plans to make the Mono runtime on Windows more userfriendly?
If I'm not mistaken, at the moment, you need to write a command line to
start an app with Mono on Windows. This is good enough for developers to
test programs and all, but not for regular users to actually run the
programs normally.

Maybe if launching apps was easier, it would actually become possible for us
developers to propose the Mono framework as an alternative to the MS .NET
one to the Windows users? Especially since GTK# is already included with it,
which makes things more simple if the .NET program relies on it. And
possibly if Mono works better on old computers (it apparently takes up more
space, though), or something, I don't know...
Like adding an option in the context menu (right click the exe / &quot;Run with
Mono&quot;), or even setting Mono as the default .NET framework, if that's even
possible.

Running Mono on Windows for common users may not sound all that exciting
since the MS .NET framework is already there and largely deployed, but I've
been reading about some things running faster with Mono than with .NET, and
with each new version, Mono is getting better and faster... So Mono on
Windows may end up boasting significant benefits over the MS .NET framework,
at least for certain apps.
