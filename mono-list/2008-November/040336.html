<PRE>
When I first installed Mono I was asked by the generic installer whether I
want it to modify my profile. I said yes. Afterwards many things were
broken. (Mono injected junk libraries in my system)
But if I simply say no, it will me tell many many wunderful things that I
should do, but that's all rubbish.

Once mono is copied into /opt/monoxxx, it JUST   SIMPLY   WORKS.

I don't care for desktops, ldconfig, all this stuff.

And if Mono would just drop the generic installer, but replace it with a
TGZ-file, everything would be finde.


Just simply use the full path to mono and I can run my exe-files and
assemblies just fine.

I just need a wrapper shell script:

#!/bin/sh
export MONO_DISABLE_SHM=1
/usr/local/mono-1.9.1/bin/mono /usr/local/sbin/XXX.exe &quot;$@&quot;

(And disable some unneeded junk by the way...)

A tgz file with a COMPLETE Mono installation would really be great.

With Windows it's the same: I don't need no stupid Shell-context menus for
XPS on strange ports.

Just a folder with mono. I just have to adjust my path in my build-script
and everything is finde.
call &quot;C:\Programme\Mono-2.0\bin\setmonopath.bat&quot;
call gmcs ....

This is (or WAS) so refreshing EASY!

I also like to keep several versions around to quickly find bugs.

Too sad that Mono is going this route. The Windows-support is now WAY better
than the linux support.

Extracting the RPMs does not work: Uniextractor and Total Command on Windows
fail and midnight commander on Linux complain about corrupt files. rpm2cpio
can extract a cpio file similar to midnight commander.

This is the result:

cpio: warning: skipped 23000 bytes of junk
o^GOD^WL&#255;&#232;-&#231;3^^&#210;^G^W^B&gt;&lt;91&gt;&lt;86&gt;&#204;^K/W^Z&lt;84&gt;&#245;IR&#221;^W^B~&#185;^&#193;&lt;94&gt;3&lt;96&gt;&#185;&#253;&#248;&lt;92&gt;^O&#196;&#230;^T&#228;&#165;&amp;^Ky&#217;^/&#239;v&#209;&#164;^^
cpio: warning: skipped 854 bytes of junk
cpio: warning: archive header has reverse byte-order
&#225;Y{O&lt;8E&gt;^AE&#243;&lt;87&gt;F&#169;a&#247;&#241;Q(^Z&#208;&lt;&#216;&lt;99&gt;b1(&lt;91&gt;f&#222;^X\&lt;90&gt;&#178;G&#219;&#206;&lt;83&gt;&#211;&#231;&#234;-


I guess I have to somehow fetch this OpenSuse-thing (whatever
Not-Debian-based thing that is) and try to extract something there :-(

BUMMER!
