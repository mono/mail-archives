<PRE>
My company have traditionally sold software and books about OCaml and 
Mathematica. Microsoft's commercialization of their OCaml-derivative F# for 
their .NET platform led us to diversify in that direction. Amongst other 
things, we are successfully selling reliable visualization software written 
in F# that uses WPF. We previously had problems with software written in 
OCaml using OpenGL and had to shelve the product line because the binaries 
would not run reliably between distros. We also had problems with F#+MDX and 
ended up rewriting everything to use WPF. Now, we really value WPF's 
reliability.

So I am interested in whether or not we could build upon the Mono project to 
develop equivalent graphical software for the Linux and Mac OS X platforms. 
We could potentially write our code in C# 3.0 but we really need reliable 
high-performance graphics. I appreciate that the Mono project will not be 
reimplementing WPF on Mono but I am wondering if any other (perhaps much 
simpler) alternatives might arise, like OpenGL-based GUI toolkits?

Consequently, I would appreciate references to commercial software using 
OpenGL that is being sold to run on Mono and any OpenGL demos or tutorials 
for Mono.

Many thanks,
