I agree with you, although I'm not quite in the same situation. You're
bothered by the fact you don't have a good mono-friendly IDE on Windows,
while I'd like to use the same IDE on both Windows and Linux.

I'm currently using SharpDevelop for my project, but recently installed
Ubuntu on my computer, and can't code in it. Completely switching to
MonoDevelop would be an option, except the Windows version doesn't really
seem ready, just installing it seems quite annoying from what I read (not to
mention my project uses Windows.Forms at the moment, and MonoDevelop has no
designer for it right now)... and since I'm working on this project with
another programmer who's on Windows, we should use the same IDE (I don't
even know whether solutions are compatible between SharpDevelop and
MonoDevelop, and couldn't find info on that at first sight...).
At the moment, I have to reboot my computer into Windows to code, which is
far from convenient.

By the way, I recently read about an interesting Mono-friendly and
cross-platform IDE called X-Develop, but there is a catch: it's not free. :p
But if you don't mind paying for it, that could be a nice solution for you.
