<PRE>
Please keep in mind that I have not downloaded Mono and I am just posting
this to get some feedback.

I am looking at looking writing an app in Windows VB.Net VS2005 and would
like to port it over to a Mac OSX.  The program also needs to connect to a
local db for a single user. If their business really takes off like they
hope then eventually I will need to move the db to a server.  

Here are somethings that I am not sure about since I have never had to write
an app for a Mac before:

1. I have looked at both Mono and MonoDevelop and see their differences and
similarities.  Is one better than the other?

2. Depending upon how question #1 is answered, what type of db would I use
with it?  

3. In Windows it would be Access or SQL, but what is it for a Mac?  Also,
what do I connect to for Windows testing?

4. Is there a better/easier way of approaching the above or am I on the
right track?

Thanks in advance.
