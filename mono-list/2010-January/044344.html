Hi,

Can you post the source code for the java sample? I have a hard time
understanding how the sample can run so fast with java, here I get the
following results:

C#: 3.346 seconds
C (compiled with gcc &#150;O3, see attached source code): 1.132 seconds

&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'm quite familiar with both the .NET and Java development environments,
</I>but only recently have begun to experiment with mono, so forgive me if I'm
not clued-in. &#160;&#160;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I specialize in numerical work that often involves a lot large-scale array
</I>manipulation for linear algebra, timeseries, etc. &#160; &#160;My main production
platforms are OSX and Linux. &#160; I've been doing most of my work on the JVM
over the &gt;past few years, though spent a couple of years with .NET when it
was pre-release / pre-1.0. &#160;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My main interest is in Ocaml, particularly the F# variant as the basis for
</I>my numerical work.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>One of the first things I do when considering a platform is run benchmarks,
</I>as performance is critical for what I do. &#160; &#160;Starting with C# I wrote a test
to gauge the array-access overhead associated with the platform. &#160;Without
&gt;<i>knowing how to tweak the mono runtime to turn on any particular
</I>optimisations, the results were quite poor for this specific test (see code
at the end of this posting).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The test on my MacPro 2.6 Ghz / Snow Leopard with mono 2.6.1 gave the
</I>result of:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	16 sec, 130 ms for 1000 iterations
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>the same code, modified just for IO, etc on the Java VM (without -server)
</I>&#160;gave a runtime of:
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>	&#160;0 sec,&#160;831 ms
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>changing the # of iterations to higher amounts did nothing to improve the
</I>ratio. &#160; Java is 20x faster in this benchmark.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I could not find any documentation concerning settings for the -optimize
</I>flag on the mono VM, so perhaps there is a setting I should be using. &#160;&#160;
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Secondly, I saw the posting concerning the optional use of LLVM. &#160;I have
</I>not been able to build mono on OSX as am having problems building glib. &#160;I'm
wondering whether anyone has a packaged up version of glib or better a
packaged up &gt;version of mono with LLVM enabled.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have heard only good things about LLVM performance, so hoping that this
</I>will help address this gap. &#160; Hopefully I am doing something wrong here and
the performance is much closer. &#160; Test code below ...
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>regards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Jonathan
