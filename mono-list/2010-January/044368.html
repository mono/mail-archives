</I>I'm intrigued - why say that?  I mean - what's the point?  What are you 
trying to achieve, really?

If someone has domain knowledge and implementation skills on top of CLR 
but can show that Mono is defective, its efinitely reasonable to ask 
them to give 'the mono development community' a test case and bug report.

But expecting them to climb the mountain of learning to fiddle with a 
particular CLR implementation's core is nuts, particularly when they 
have an alternate that works for them to do their day job. If someone 
wanted to climb that mountain and make the changes, then presumably they 
would want to start by reading the copious up to date detailed design 
documentation and implementation notes on how (and why) it works now,  
so that they could size the task.  Oh wait ... :-(

Its much, much more efficient for someone who already groks the 
internals to make fiddly low-level changes, particularly if getting them 
into the release stream requires a lot of trust relationship with the 
release masters. I think you do a huge disservice to everyone by trying 
to get outsiders to work on something like that - or perhaps you just 
want people with bad news to go away so you can paper over the cracks?

Please, ask for test cases and reports.  FWIW I suspect (justa hunch, 
I'm certainly not an expert) from what's been said that if a calling 
convention change is needed (and I seem to remember there are some 
issues that prevent fuller use of LLVM that one might also want to 
consider if that sort of change is on the cards) then its as much a 
political and major-version-compatibility issue as it is technical, and 
once again asking someone to work on patches in such a situation is 
laughable, given the degree of risk that they might completely waste 
their time.
