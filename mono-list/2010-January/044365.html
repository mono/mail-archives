I used this facility a few yrs ago.  It's quite nice.   I think it was Reflect.Emit.   Basically took a finance related DSL and compiled it on the fly.   It's probably changed a lot since then.

Well, I'm not sure how to make a compelling case ; ), other than that to allow standard F# programs to execute on mono would require TCO.   TC's are a fundamental in F#.

I'm not sure how big the F# community is.  I would guess it is not that large at the moment, but seems to have a lot of growth.    F# joining the list of fully supported languages in VS2010 should attract much wider use.   Some of these users will be looking for a cross-platform solution.

If it counts for anything, would love to be able to use this on mono ;)
