We used to make binary packages but they aren't upgradeable via the
distribution's package system. You really really want it to be
upgradeable via the package system and have the package system be aware
of the Mono installation, otherwise the system quickly becomes a mess. I
doubt you have the binary install of Java or OpenOffice on your machine.
I'm sure you've gotten them via the package manager from your distro.

There are people working on making Ubuntu packages (that also make the
official ubuntu/debian packages).

&gt;<i> I can see that Novell need SLES to be the best platform for Mono for 
</I>&gt;<i> commercial, but I think it needs to be ubiquitous first and then given 
</I>&gt;<i> value add on the Novell product - and that means better support for 
</I>&gt;<i> other Linuxen, and OpenSolaris, and FreeBSD.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
We are always accepting patches to make it work better on other
platforms - there's no plot to make Mono work best on SLE (it's the same
Mono as on every other platform).
