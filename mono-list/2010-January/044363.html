There are many different solutions. The simplest would be to use LLVM's fast 
calling convention and tail calls as HLVM does.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; To be honest I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would get more value out of a Ocaml variant wedded to the .NET platform.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes. F# is awesome but only on Windows/.NET and not on Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, very problematic for me ...
</I>
That's why Microsoft did it. ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There is just so much momentum and available libraries on the two major
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; VMs (CLR and JVM), that would be a huge risk for me at the moment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was actually disappointed with .NET's libraries in the context of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technical computing. I felt OCaml had better libraries and it turns out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that .NET was about as popular for technical computing as OCaml was when
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I started. The main exception is WPF but you don't get that with Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess it depends where you come from.  First I'll have to be honest and
</I>&gt;<i> say that I am new to Ocaml.    My FP background is Scheme and some dabbling
</I>&gt;<i> in Haskell.    I had heard from real-world users of Ocaml (such as the Jane
</I>&gt;<i> Street capital guys), that the depth of libraries for Ocaml is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> shallow.    They've invested some years into building that up, but is
</I>&gt;<i> private work largely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now if we are talking about numerical stuff, then yes, there is not much
</I>&gt;<i> publicly available on either the CLR or JVM.    I was more referring to the
</I>&gt;<i> tech libraries rather than scientific.
</I>
Yes. Technical libraries (e.g. graphing) are far more advanced on .NET. I was 
referring only to numerical libraries like BLAS, LAPACK, FFTW and GSL.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have a significant body of imperative VM-bound code that I need to get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; access to.    If HLVM could interact with java bytecode or .NET
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; bytecode, would work for me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You should be able to compile plain numerical code from JVM/CIL to HLVM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easily enough, particularly when HLVM is more complete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll look forward to seeing that.   Are you implying that I would be able
</I>&gt;<i> to take a bunch of java classes and make them available?    I guess it
</I>&gt;<i> depends on what you mean by &quot;plain numerical&quot; code.
</I>
I mean code like your test1 function. That has an obvious direct translation 
into HLVM code.

&gt;<i> Will or does HLVM support the F# dialect of Ocaml as well?
</I>
HLVM is designed to be a language agnostic VM so it could support either in 
theory. In practice, I will probably create a new language and any others 
will be ports done by other people. Currently, both OCaml and F# box tuples 
which would be a disaster on HLVM because my GC is not optimized for 
short-lived values. Objectively, F# should not box tuples either. In fact, if 
Mono implemented TCO and structs correctly and its own F# then it could unbox 
tuples and would see huge performance improvements as a consequence.

&gt;<i> &gt; That doesn't really interest me. F# is so far ahead now that everything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; else is a toy in comparison from my point of view. HLVM is just a hobby
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project designed to bring some of the benefits of F# to the open source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; world for fun but it is a massive undertaking because the open source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; world doesn't even have any reliable foundations like .NET, let alone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decent libraries like WPF built upon them. So I have to build everything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from scratch myself. I'm not even sure I will be able to use hardware
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acceleration due to the poor state of OpenGL drivers on Linux.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough.   I recognize that you have accomplished quite a bit with the
</I>&gt;<i> performance of your design.   However, as you allude to, it is quite
</I>&gt;<i> another thing to enrich it to the point of being a broad-use platform.  
</I>&gt;<i> For that you need a group of dedicated developers and the momentum to
</I>&gt;<i> foster that community.
</I>
Yes. I don't think that will be a problem. So many people love OCaml but want 
decent multicore support that they would leap on HLVM if only it had a decent 
front end and a couple more features. Those are easy enough to implement, it 
is just a question of me finding the time. :-)

&gt;<i> The MS CLR and Mono may never have the specializations that you have done,
</I>&gt;<i> for instance, make boxing / unboxing a non-issue (or at least a lot
</I>&gt;<i> cheaper).    However, they have momentum and breadth.    Getting the best
</I>&gt;<i> of both would be super, but I understand ...
</I>
.NET has momentum and breadth that I can never hope to attain but Mono's level 
of adoption seems entirely achievable to me.

&gt;<i> &gt; You cannot work around boxing on the JVM because it lacks value types.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Indeed, that is a major advantage of .NET on the JVM that Mono should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inherit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm totally with you on .NET over the JVM.    Sun sat on the JVM and Java
</I>&gt;<i> design for many years.    Catchup now is too late.
</I>
Yep. They've left a huge gap in the market for Mono though. :-)

Just to clarify my point, if you benchmark these Java and C# programs that put 
10M floats into a hash table:

  import java.util.HashMap;
  
  public class Hashtbl {
    public static void main(String args[]){
      int n = 10000000;
      HashMap hashtable = new HashMap(n);
  
      for(int i=1; i&lt;=n; ++i) {
        double x = i;
        hashtable.put(x, 1.0 / x);
      }
  
      System.out.println(&quot;hashtable(100.0) = &quot; + hashtable.get(100.0));
    }
  }
  
  using System.Collections.Generic;
  
  public class Hashtbl {
    public static void Main(){
      int n = 10000000;
      Dictionary&lt;double, double&gt; hashtable = new Dictionary&lt;double, 
double&gt;(n);
  
      for(int i=1; i&lt;=n; ++i) {
        double x = i;
        hashtable[x] = 1.0 / x;
      }
  
      System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;hashtable(100.0) = &quot; + hashtable[100.0]);
    }
  }

You'll find that Mono is 24x faster than Java in real time and 94x faster in 
terms of CPU time:

  $ java -version
  java version &quot;1.6.0_17&quot;
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_17-b04)
  Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 14.3-b01, mixed mode)
  $ time java Hashtbl
  hashtable(100.0) = 0.01
  
  real    0m37.379s
  user    2m7.404s
  sys     0m2.788s
  
  $ mono --version

  $ time ./Hashtbl.exe

  real    0m1.555s
  user    0m1.360s
  sys     0m0.184s

Coupled with the fact that Java's FFI is disasterously slow as well and you've 
got a ticking time bomb of crippling design flaws in the JVM that you will 
not be able to escape from.

The moral: don't let Guy Steele drag you halfway to Lisp if you want 
performance that doesn't suck. ;-)
