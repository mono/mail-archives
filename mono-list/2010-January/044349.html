<PRE>If you mean you want the SIMD extensions to be part of the .NET 5.0+
specification, then that may be an option in the future should someone
decide that it's worth all the paperwork and time involved. As it stands,
Mono is the only VM (that I know of) that allows you access the various SIMD
instruction sets available on modern CPUs.

While GPU accellerated code may be possible in the future, that would have
to built on top of whatever API the GPU exposes (CUDA or whatever). That
would be completely separate to Mono.SIMD as this just exposes additional
CPU instruction sets to .NET languages.

Alan.
