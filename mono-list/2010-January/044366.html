And F# will be a standard .NET language as part of VS2010 in 2 months.

The F# Hub has 16,582 registered members. The mono-devel Ubuntu package has 
19,792 installs and 2,309 active users.

If the F# community is not already bigger than the Mono community then it 
certainly will be when Microsoft drop it on 10,000,000 developers for free in 
March.

&gt;<i> F# joining the list of fully supported languages in VS2010 should attract
</I>&gt;<i> much wider use. Some of these users will be looking for a cross-platform

</I>
I believe two or three of our ~1,000 customers is trying to use F# on Linux or 
Mac OS X.

&gt;<i> If it counts for anything, would love to be able to use this on mono ;)
</I>
Yes. Many people (such as myself) would also be far more inclined to 
contribute code to Mono if it could be written in F#. I have no desire to 
write C#.
