<PRE>Hi, there are days that I am really proud of being part of the OWASP
community, today is one of those days :)

The Haiti tragedy prompt the OWASP community to kickstart a project that we
have talked about several times in the past but never got around to do it:
the OWASP for Charities project.

You can read all about it in the email included below. This email was sent
to all our mailing-list subscribers (more than 10,000), and it looks like we
are on to something, since we already had some great responses. One in
particular was really good: *&quot;...rebuild digital infrastructure ... there is
a need for IT infrastructure to support the  immediate relief efforts...
people to set up local networks and links between the diff countries (US,
France, Spain, etc) who are all working to aid but are not tied together....
 or help keep PCs/net work devices etc running, basic tech support...&quot;*

I just wrote a blog entry with the email's content (
<A HREF="http://bit.ly/OWASP-Haiti">http://bit.ly/OWASP-Haiti</A>) and I would really appreciate if you linked to
it, or just reused its content on your own blog, or redistributed it to your
internal/external mailing lists.

Lets use this opportunity to build a team that is focused on helping others,
since we never know where it will happen next.

Please join us at the OWASP for Charities project, and in the short term in
supporting the Haiti relief effort.

Thanks

OWASP Members and Supporters,

OWASP was founded, and is supported as a non-profit organization, by a group
of dedicated volunteers who believe that all applications should be secure
and trusted.  As our organization matures we have taken those beliefs
broader, and have started setting up ways for our members to donate to the
global community.  Among these initiatives are:

   - OWASP has an active Kiva lending team who have donated $9,125.00 to
   date.  <A HREF="http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=522">http://www.kiva.org/community/viewTeam?team_id=522</A>
   - OWASP in response to the need in Haiti has set up a secure and trusted
   way for those within the OWASP community to donate funds to help the people
   of Haiti. This allows our OWASP community to help another with a single
   global voice.  100% of the collected donations will be transferred directly
   to victims for disaster relief such as food and medical requirements.
   Please visit www.owasp.org and click the link for G33k-4-HAITI.  In a
   time of crisis, OWASP can help those who are in great need. The OWASP
   community can help organize, support , and promote efforts outside of
   application security.

OWASP is well aware there is a movement for phishers to utilize this tragedy
to get unsuspecting people to donate to a &#8220;cause&#8221; without having a
legitimate business back end and ultimately funneling all the money directly
into their own pockets.  The OWASP community is uniquely qualified to help
protect from this type of attack and educate about attacks as well.

As the world becomes more dependent on technology and particularly web
applications, there are many who need protection who simply have no options
to protect themselves.  These include small companies, individuals,
charities, and others.  The OWASP community can help by connecting
qualified, trusted resources willing to volunteer their time to those
organizations which qualify. OWASP is setting up an outreach program, which
will be under the name project name of OWASP for Charities.

We hope you will support OWASPs efforts to make a difference  in any of the
above ways. We are also open to suggestions in regards to where you feel the
OWASP Community can be of service.

Regards,

Your OWASP Board
