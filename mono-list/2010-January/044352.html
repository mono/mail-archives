<PRE>
I'm having some difficulties with one of my projects, it's a windows forms
application that runs perfectly on windows whit .NET Framework. I want to
get it running on MacOS. I had no problem getting my project to compile with
mono, but as soon as I run it I get a lot of messages saying: 

WARNING: CFSTR(&quot;...&quot;) has non-7 bit chars, interpreting using MacOS Roman
encoding for now, but this will change. Please eliminate usages of non-7 bit
chars (including escaped characters above \177 octal) in CFSTR().

My program is written in swedish so I have the letter &#229;&#228;&#246; here and there,
the message above appears every time I use one of those letters on a button,
label, etc. I tried to change the letter &#229;&#228;&#246; to regular ones and then the
messages disappeared, so I'm quite sure it has nothing to do with some
strange font on my forms.

I've seen some post referring to the same problem as I have but I haven't
seen any answers and I don't no how to get around it, I need some help! Does
anyone have a solution?
