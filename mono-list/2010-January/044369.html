<PRE>James, just FYI,  Miguel indicates that the mono team does plan to support TCO / F# fully.   I am also hoping that mono will continue to build out to the LLVM backend given the amount of investment that's been put into LLVM.   The performance results look very promising  (I am waiting for 64 bit support on OSX to test it out for myself).

This is an open source project, for which some of us benefit for free.  So from that perspective I think it is fair to try to solicit work from parties of interest.   However, as you point out, someone like myself is not really a developer in the VM space, so for me would be inappropriate.   I do numerical work and trading in the financial markets ...

</I>&gt;<i> once again asking someone to work on patches in such a situation is 
</I>&gt;<i> laughable, given the degree of risk that they might completely waste
