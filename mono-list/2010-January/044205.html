</I>You have to make the installation effectively self-contained. Everything 
you say would apply to Java too - but there's just two files for that - 
a .bin and a .rpm.

Why do you need to 'integrate with' a downlevel packaged installation?  
And why care about the rest of it?  Novell would be in the same boat as 
Sun: you can supply a standalone integrated (and controlled) universal 
bin, and let the packagers do what they can with the open source bits - 
and let the users choose.  I'd not expect the bin to live in an 
repository - just for a simple script to do the download to be the 
package for the bin: pretty much as it is with the Sun JVM and Adobe 
Acrobat.

Removing distro-provided Java bits is the first thing I do after 
installation.
