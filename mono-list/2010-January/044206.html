Right, but there's one crucial difference between Java and Mono.  Mono
wraps native libraries; Java doesn't.

For examle, libwnck?  Exposed by wnck-sharp, not available in Java.  
GTK+?  Exposed by Gtk#, not available in Java.  FreeType?  Ditto.
Gnome?  Ditto.

The short of it is that Mono directly and indirectly wraps lots of
native libraries in ways that Java does not.

As a consequence, a &quot;self-contained&quot; install would require bundling all
of these dependencies -- a completely separate freetype, GTK+, gnome,
etc., etc.  It would be *huge*.

Which is why the original &quot;self-contained&quot; installer wasn't: it relied
on the system GTK+, system freetype, etc.  This shows up lots of bugs as
people would try to install it onto GTK+ 2.2 systems (sufficiently old
that you don't want to go there), and people would be shocked --
shocked, I tell you! -- that Gtk# apps didn't work there.

I believe there were also LD_LIBRARY_PATH issues, where people would
often not have their environment properly sourced, leading to
&quot;mis-matched&quot; libraries being loaded into the process.  This leads to no
end of madness as well.

So, can it be done?  Sure.  Is it a good idea?  After years of trying,
we decided that it wasn't worth doing.  (But if you'd like to try,
please feel free to...)

&gt;<i> &gt; So, in short, universal binaries are not all they're cracked up to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; due to issues with maintaining a stable ABI and API, and integrating 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with the system, including integrating with a potential packaged

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; done incorrectly are a huge hassle). As an aside, they would also 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; force Mono out of the free repositories into non-free repositories for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distros which have strict from-source policies, and we don't want to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; add more fuel to *that* fire.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why do you need to 'integrate with' a downlevel packaged installation?
</I>
Again, we 'integrate with' system-provided libraries, and it wouldn't
surprise me if e.g. Clipboard format of something generated by GTK+
changed between GTK+ versions, so it's conceivable that copy&amp;paste
between a &quot;self-contained Gtk# app&quot; and a system-provided GTK+ app might
break in unpredictable ways.  (Mixing versions of libraries does things
like that.)  It's not for the faint of heart.
  
&gt;<i> And why care about the rest of it?  Novell would be in the same boat as 
</I>&gt;<i> Sun:
</I>
As mentioned above, Sun isn't in this boat because their &quot;pure Java&quot;
initatives makes such native library wrapping verboten (or at least very
rare).  They don't depend on all these native libraries, not in the same
way that Mono does.
