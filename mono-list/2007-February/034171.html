<PRE>But I'm not responsible for the server side of this. I'm only writing a
client using the service. And simply searching for 'ssl' mono's page
doesn't return anything.

Besides, the error was the it was unable to connect, not that some
certificate had expired. I guess that .Net in windows would complain too
if that was the case.

Btw: I did attach the .wsdl to my first post, so others should be able
to confirm that this doesn't work too well.
