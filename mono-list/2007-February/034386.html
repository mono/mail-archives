<PRE>&gt;<i> Joseph Hill set up GotMono (<A HREF="http://gotmono.net/">http://gotmono.net/</A>) a while ago. I know
</I>&gt;<i> he's been busy lately, but he might know of someone who could take
</I>&gt;<i> over this community site.
</I>&gt;<i> While on the topic of domains, I have mono-host.com sitting around if
</I>&gt;<i> anyone knows of a good home for it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a domain name, MONO247.com, as in Mono 24/7 (24 hours 7 days a week).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I have had this domain sitting around for a long time and was wondering if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there was any interest turning this in to a community site or some sorts to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help support all the Mono developers that live and breath this project on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; daily basis.
</I>
Seems to me there are already several Mono community sites;  doesn't
seem to me to be much point in spreading out the community even further
(most of the community sites aren't terribly active).  Just my two
cents.

Nice domain name though.

&gt;<i> &gt; Please add your suggestions to this thread, I currently don't have a host
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the domain name, and it is a shame that it has been sitting around for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2+ years now with little to no work done on it from my side of things.
</I>
