<PRE>I downloaded the sources from debian sid, and compiled it under debian
testing (aka 'etch').
I both tried running the old binary AND compiling it again. Do you know
what? Same reslut :(
Like I said before, since .wsdl files that are not using SSL works, I
have a feeling there's something regarding the SSL part that is buggy.

..and since my code did work as expected in windows, mono is definetely
the problem here

Btw: the version of mono I downloaded was 1.2.2.1

Too bad that .Net was the best way of doing SOAP, now I have to find
another way of doing it (and more work :( )

</I>&gt;<i> Btw: I'm using Mono v 1.1.17.1 (from latest ubuntu)
</I>

Webservices has been improved considerably in the latest releases so I 
would recommend you to upgrade (to 1.2.2.1 or 1.2.3) and test again.
