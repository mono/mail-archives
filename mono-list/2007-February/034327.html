reference to the path.

eg.. -r  
/usr/lib/mono/gac/nunit.core/2.2.0.0__96d09a1eb7f44a77/nunit.core.dll

Also. if you need 2.0 support you're going to have to go grab a more 
recent version of nunit from their download site.  I wish I had time to 
make a clean patch to update the nunit included with Mono..  Also.. 
doing so could break other commons apps like MD. log4net. etc..

I don't use nunit in any of my apps, but to the best of my knowledge if 
you're compiling against the version that comes bundled with mono.. you 
don't have to include anything else with your app.

Good luck
