&gt;<i> For since as long as I can remember the question of what should be used 
</I>&gt;<i> for hacking mono has come up.  On irc and in the ml we've all seen it. 
</I>&gt;<i> I've recently tried to use monodevelop (MD) once again and been faced 
</I>&gt;<i> with quite a few undocumented features.  Some trivial and some unknown 
</I>&gt;<i> to me how complicated the fix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Short list:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) <A HREF="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=80433">http://bugzilla.ximian.com/show_bug.cgi?id=80433</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) aspnetedit (very easy to cause an exception here)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) If you're using a recent version of UNunit you must (--disable-nunit 
</I>&gt;<i> --disable-monoextensions )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In general creating a VS clone is probably a good idea to bring more 
</I>&gt;<i> developers over to the Mono side, but I think MD needs a boost of 
</I>&gt;<i> support from the community.  If you think it's a good idea to have a 
</I>&gt;<i> month of MD hacking, bug fixes and or new features then post your 
</I>&gt;<i> support.  Maybe we can even create a wiki page and REALLY try to push 
</I>&gt;<i> this.  Lets really push to answer this nagging question of what is the 
</I>&gt;<i> best open source C# ide for mono.
</I>
I also like the idea of pushing MD, however, I'd like to know what
&quot;month of hacking&quot; really should be.

A few months ago a release plan for MonoDevelop was presented, with a
detailed list of features and fixes we'd like to have for MD 1.0. This
plan was discussed in the mailing list, it was updated from people's
feedback, and several people showed interest in helping. But that's all,
we've got very little contributions so far.

Maybe people is too busy to help (I know some of them are). Maybe it's
my fault in not being able to encourage new contributors to help. I
don't know.

So, what do you think a &quot;month of hacking&quot; should really be? As a
potential project contributor, what would make a difference to you, so
you would decide to start helping? Which information would you expect
the wiki you propose to have? Which commitments should we (regular
project maintainers) take in order to help you and other contributors
during this month? (maybe provide more internal (documentation?, maybe
more support on irc/mailing list?). I'm asking for specific ideas,
because just declaring a &quot;month of hacking&quot; won't magically bring more
hackers.

Thanks!
Lluis.
