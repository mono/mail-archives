<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; Okay, are you using the FC mono packages or the ones from Novell? 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would *strongly* advice FC users from using the Novell packages -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; massively advice against it, infact, think of the most lavish, expensive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hotel you can, 24 hour porterage, thick shagpile throughout everywhere,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unrestricted TV and internet access and outside, the words &quot;Bloody Huge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and Expensive Hotel Ltd&quot;, that how much I would advise against using the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Novell packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could you provide some technical reasons about what is wrong with our
</I>&gt;<i> packages so we can improve it?
</I>
Having the libs in the incorrect place for non-x86 systems seems like a
good start. If you're running on a 64 bit processor, things should be
in /usr/lib64 - it means you have a true hardware agnostic approach and
you don't pollute the 32 bit libs directories with material which really
shouldn't be there.

The Fedora developers have spent a heck of a long time making sure libs
go into the correct place and between us, spent ages discussing where
they should go - and that was even before Fedora had it!

&gt;<i> We have noticed that Fedora packages seem to be incorrect.   They are
</I>&gt;<i> creating -devel packages that merely contain .pc files, which is not
</I>&gt;<i> necessary with Mono, so we believe the Fedora packages are incorrect. 
</I>
Each to their own on that score. We have -devel files with .pc files in
for a reason - they belong there, they are after all part of the
development stuff and not the core package.

You'll find it's the same across the board in fedora, it's part of our
packaging standards.

TTFN

Paul
