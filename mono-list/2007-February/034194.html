<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Maybe it would be good form to start even an online publication on mono,
</I>&gt;<i> or get one of the several linux publications to do a series on development 
</I>&gt;<i> with the mono framework..?
</I>
It would be great.

A few years ago, we had the &quot;Mono Weekly News&quot; which covered
developments on SVN, new features, discussions on the mailing lists and
irc.

I miss those days;   Although I try to capture the &quot;high level&quot; news on
the release notes, the release notes are not the right vehicle to pass
information around.

I think the Mono Weekly News could come in the form of a blog.

&gt;<i> Without an increasing mindshare, I think that to some extent adoption will
</I>&gt;<i> stagnate a bit... most of the people I know that are .Net developers have
</I>&gt;<i> the following response, or one like it... &quot;I looked at Mono a couple years
</I>&gt;<i> ago, but it was (too hard to configure|didn't run my project), and haven't
</I>&gt;<i> looked at it since...&quot;
</I>
I agree.   We should for instance track the progress in Moma (see the
&quot;change&quot; field in our Moma reports).

The major issue, as always, is that someone needs to &quot;own&quot; this task and
run with it.
 
Miguel.
</PRE>
