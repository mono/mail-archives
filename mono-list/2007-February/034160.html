<PRE>I had to write a program using SOAP for an SMS service. I had never
written anything using SOAP before, and noticed that Mono had this nice
'wsdl' tool. 
First I tried using a normal public soap service, and all was fine.
However, when I used the actual service we were supposed to be using,
things did NOT work too well:

------------- error message ---------------
Unhandled Exception: System.Net.WebException: Error writing request.
  at System.Net.WebConnectionStream.WriteRequest () [0x00000] 
  at System.Net.WebConnectionStream.Close () [0x00000] 
  at System.IO.StreamWriter.Dispose (Boolean disposing) [0x00000] 
  at System.IO.StreamWriter.Close () [0x00000] 
  at System.Xml.XmlTextWriter.Close () [0x00000] 
  at System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol.SendRequest
(System.IO.Stream s, System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapClientMessage
message, System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapExtension[] extensions)
[0x00000] 
  at System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapHttpClientProtocol.Invoke
(System.String method_name, System.Object[] parameters) [0x00000] 
------------- error message ---------------

At first I thought I had done something wrong, but when compiling and
running under Visual Studio Express for C#, everything worked, without
any exceptions. (Running the compiled binary using Mono gave the same
error)

My suspicion is that for some reason Mono does not support Soap when
using SSL.

I attach the .wsdl for the service causing these problems.

Btw: I'm using Mono v 1.1.17.1 (from latest ubuntu)

I also noticed that Mono v2 has been released, anyone who can confirm
whether the same error occurs in that release or not?

Thanks!
