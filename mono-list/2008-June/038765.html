<PRE>I've attached the relevant data from your .resx file.  A quick guess 
says it's probably using a culture that uses comma separators instead of 
decimal points for numbers, and our code is not international-proof.

This should be pretty easy to fix.  Either Andy or I will probably get 
to it in the next couple of days.

Thanks for sending your files!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The whole solution initially started as a VC# 2005 Express solution; and was

</I>&gt;<i> aim of defining some extension methods. For what it matters, most of the
</I>&gt;<i> code (including the parts causing the problem, which are quite recent), has
</I>&gt;<i> been developed under VC# 2008 Express.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to check them, I'm attaching the two .cs files (my code and the
</I>&gt;<i> .Designer.cs), and the resx files for the UserControl that is raising the

</I>&gt;<i> actual application is a mere wrapping just to test that control).

</I>&gt;<i> arguments I'd want?&quot;... which involves a lot of reflection and even more
</I>&gt;<i> headaches. I'll try to use reflection to &quot;dig&quot; into these calls and retrieve
