</I>I can confirm your guess: I did a bit of testing and replaced all these
33,3333 values in the resx file by 33: integer, so no issue about decimal
separators. There might be a bit of precission loss in the distribution of
the table rows (anyway, that's less than 1% in the worst case). After that,
I recompiled from VS and tried it with Mono: everything is working fine now.
Also, I'm working on a machine with a Spanish version of Windows and the
regional configuration set to Catalan: both cultures use the comma as the
decimal separator.
Seeing the parts of the .resx file you highlighted, the issue seems quite
obvious: comma-separated values where some of the values contain commas
themselves: how could that **not** cause problems?
I think the bug should be fixed, because it's a bug after all; but right now
my program is able to just avoid it. If there is anything I can do to help
fixing it, just let me know.

</I>Thanks to all of you for all the help! Once finished, the project is going
to be published under GPL, so sharing some sources was not a problem :P
