<PRE>Ysgrifennodd Sebastien Pouliot:
&gt;<i> Hello Peter,
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Hi, Sebastien

&gt;<i> I'll review the page to update the status for the upcoming Mono 2.0 - a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of things have improved since 1.1.x ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I'm sure they have.  I like mono.  I think it has a way to go, but the 
achievements so far are impressive (and they got me an MSc, to I owe a 
debt of gratitude)

&gt;<i> That's the Microsoft version of the .NET framework - which is not
</I>&gt;<i> identical to Mono versioning (lots of MS FX 2.0 stuff was functional in
</I>&gt;<i> Mono 1.2.x).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Oh right.  I see.  Proves the point, really, about how easily I get 
confused.  If you can write docs that I can understand, you've probably 
sorted 100% of the likely user population.

&gt;<i> You did not (sounds too negative) and it should* work with Mono 1.9.1 or
</I>&gt;<i> later (to which you can update using openSUSE build service).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * should == will if you read the security FAQ ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
And I will do that, when I get time Sebastien.  As I said, it's not a 
priority with me right now as the application isn't fully functional yet 
(although I have succeeded in successfully negotiating a login (on 
Windows) this evening, so I met today's milestone).

&gt;&gt;<i> Many thanks for the reply.  I don't think you need to review the docs.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's probably me that needs to get my grey cells serviced.  They're long 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overdue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So are mines ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
lol

Thanks for all your help, Sebastien.  When I've done my homework, I'll 
get back to the forum if I still can't make it work.  I have actually 
just posted that upgrading to 1.9.1 didn't solve the problem (although 
it changed it).  I suspect that reading the FAQ would help me out with 
that, so at the first sign of frustration, I'll leave off posting until 
I've read the docs.

Cheers


Peter
