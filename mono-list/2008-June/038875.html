That almost looked like three answers ;-)

Let me resume it into one: 
There is currently no way to execute untrusted code safely using (only)
Mono.


Now in more details...

* Mono Code Access Security (CAS) implementation is incomplete and
unsupported. You're welcome to play with it (see &quot;man mono&quot;) and
contributions are welcome - but this is not an easy task (i.e. a few
people asked how, but none ever send any patches). *Nobody* is currently
working on it (or have been working for more than two years).

* The security model used by Silverlight (SL) 2.0, which Moonlight 2.0
must implement, is much easier (to understand and implement) that CAS.
Work on this has started (in the runtime) and will be completed for the
Moonlight 2.0 release (i.e. *people* are working on this).

* CAS and the SL model share some common stuff (like the verifier) so
implementing CAS after Moonlight 2.0 will be easier - *if* someone
decide to so ;-)

* There are some alternatives being used right now that involve custom
code (by embedding mono) to provide a &quot;safety net&quot;. Someone could also
use AppArmor policies around a custom mono VM, or application, to
accomplish *some* of CAS goals. This works as long as you understand the
limitations around them (i.e. *you* are taking the responsibility to
filter untrusted code and feed mono only safe code).
