<PRE>
ok So hears the deal now. I have another method of getting the frames to jpg.
So now I am working with the simple fact every 10 seconds I want to show a
new frame for now. but my problem is I have a window with a Gtk.Image widget
and I have loaded up a dynamic pixbuf with that image and for now I have a
timer object in the future no but for testing purposes I am using a timer. I
have on each timer_Elapsed even i create a new Pixbuff from a new image. and
clear or not clear the widget. then I set the Pixbuf for the image widget
and after about 2 or three ticks of the timer I get no images showing up.
Now this is odd. I also notice that my memory is going crazy. so i added a
GC.Collect. in there for good measure and that allows me a few more ticks
but then back to the same issue nothing after the 5 frame. I will attach my
code. any advice would be helpfull I am going nuts on this. Something I
normaly would be able to do in ms world not working as I would expect it
here. But I am sure it is because I dont understand something about the gtk
and gdk libs. when looking at the code you will notice commented code paths
I have tried. I am thinking it might be timeout issues. 

thanks,
Terry
