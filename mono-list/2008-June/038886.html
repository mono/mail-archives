all,
I am trying to build some video survalance software in MONO. I am using
ubuntu(latest). i have been a .net developer since it was beta. Now I have
an interesting issue I am moving to mono and I am trying to figure out
pipes. meaning I have a device that streams pure mpeg video I can cat out to
a file and then open it with a player and get farily live feeds of video.
but What i want to do is bypass that I want to be able to extract frames
from the stream look for motion and if I can get them to a pixbuf
compatiable format I should be fine my issue is I need to do that converion
piece any Ideas would be of great help I also would like to get access to
the device stream directly rather than stream to a file that step seems a
little extra and requres too much disk space. 
Thanks,
Terry Massey
New to mono but loving it!
