Hi,

I wonder if anyone could explain to me what is the status of SslStream?  I
looked around the go-mono site and the info there appeared to be saying that
it would be in the Crimson package, which would not be a part of the
standard mono installation.  But I think I may have misunderstood something.

The reason that I'm asking is that I am working on a project for a client
that uses an SslStream and X509 Certificate authentication to connect to a
server.  All the development is being done in VS under Windows, but I would
very much like for the resulting assemblies to work under Mono.  At the
moment if I try to run the application (such as it currently is) under Mono,
I get a NotImplementedException (I think that's right.  I'm away from my
Linux box at the moment, so can't check.  It's pretty similar to that,
though).

If the implementation will not be a part of the standard mono package, it
would make distributing the finished application a bit more difficult - for
anyone wishing to use it on Windows.

I'd be interested to know of timescales, as well, if anyone knows when this
implementation is likely to hit the streets :)

Many thanks,


Peter
