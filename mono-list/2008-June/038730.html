Could you be more specific ? e.g. does it just &quot;freeze&quot; there without
showing anything or do you get the command prompt back ? is an empty
window visible ? or a new process ?

&gt;<i> When I found about the -v switch, I got what I'd

</I>&gt;<i> OutOfMemoryException's, NullReferenceException's and
</I>&gt;<i> StackOverflowException's constructors: this cannot be good at all.
</I>
Actually you're wrong because it's good ;-). The exception are created,
not thrown, at the start of the application because, when the right
situation occurs (like an being out of memory) it's a bad time to create
(allocate) an exception but the perfect time to throw the existing one.

&gt;<i> I have tried a few helloworld-like programs, to make sure that mono was
</I>&gt;<i> working properly, and they ran fine.
</I>
And they all should show the same exception creation when starting.

&gt;<i> I have absolutelly no previous experience with Mono, and very limited
</I>&gt;<i> experience with non-Windows systems (except some DOS tinkering long ago), so
</I>&gt;<i> I'm completelly lost. I have no idea about how to debug the assembly in mono
</I>&gt;<i> (ie: try to see what's causing these exceptions), nor even how to compile my
</I>&gt;<i> project using mono's compiler instead of Microsoft's (maybe the visual
</I>&gt;<i> compiler is doing something weird). Worst of all (the previous would be
</I>&gt;<i> actually good otherwise, since it's a chance to learn and a challenge), I've
</I>&gt;<i> been unable to find any sources about these &quot;basic&quot; topics on the web, such
</I>&gt;<i> as tutorials, faqs, troubleshooting examples... absolutely nothing after 3
</I>&gt;<i> hours of googling.
</I>&gt;<i> So, could someone please point me to any resource to, at least, get started
</I>&gt;<i> in the topic?
</I>
Start by providing some basic info, like are you using Mono on Windows,
Linux, other OS ? which distro/version (OS) and package/version for
Mono ...

&gt;<i> Thanks in advance, both on my part and on that of any &quot;non-Windowed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> potential user for my project.
