</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've looked through some code samples and the msdn articles on the Cms

</I>&gt;<i> stuff (windows certificate store, installed CSPs) to get hold of the
</I>&gt;<i> private key which makes it impossible for me to use it non non-windows
</I>&gt;<i> systems with a smartcard.
</I>
MSDN samples only have to work on Windows so they often jump to the
easiest solutions ;-) However it should be possible to make Cms class,
once completed, work under Mono / non-Windows OS. 

note: since a lot of code copy from MSDN samples it's likely they won't
work without modification - but that should not influence your own code.

&gt;<i> &gt; [1] it's a bit more complex under MS implementation since the [RSA|
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DSA]CryptoServiceProvider are special cases that do not play well with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other, more general, classes. A possible solution is to supply a native
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CSP and use the *CryptoServiceProvider to access it (but that won't work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on Mono).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess that writing my own CSP is not really an option, especially since
</I>&gt;<i> I want a portable program.
</I>
I would not advise it. It's quite complex since you have to supply a lot
of extra logic (90%) beside what you want to add (10%).

&gt;<i> &gt; [2] some hardware, like smartcards, have limitations that does not fit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well with (most) cryptographic API. E.g. some will do the padding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; themselves and that, in the .NET framework case, will require you to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provider your own [Def|F]ormatter classes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sebastien
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; p.s. you jumped from SignedCms to SignedXml ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  On Purpose. I just wanted to state, that what I want to worked for me for
</I>&gt;<i> SignedXml (by deriving from RSA, and with your help, of course :-) ) but
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem to work for PKCS#7 signatures, at least wast of windows ...
</I>
AFAIK it should work based on the design - but I could be wrong (it's
been known to happen ;-) and I did not try it myself...
