The lesson is 'we need you to make mono better' ;-).

The bug you reported was already fixed in svn head.

We know that 1.1.9 had a lot of problems in system.web, as there was a
major rewrite of several thousand lines. Since 1.1.9, I've been fixing
all the reported regressions as fast as I could. If you use
System.Web.dll from head
(<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~gonzalo/System.Web.dll.gz">http://primates.ximian.com/~gonzalo/System.Web.dll.gz</A>) you'll see that
we're pretty much back to where we were in 1.1.8.x, i.e., no known
showstoppers. If you and others didn't report all the bugs you found, we
wouldn't be here.

I hope that the trouble we caused with the rewrite is compensated with
the improved performance and memory usage we got. I still have to blog
some numbers about this, but it's a big win.

Cheers.
