<PRE>Yes, it is fixed now.  I'm guessing I overwrote my System.Web.dll file when
I upgraded from Mono 1.1.9.1 to Mono 1.1.9.2 yesterday using Red Carpet.  If
that is the case, then my frustration lies with an older System.Web.dll file
being release through Red Carpet after it has already been fixed (when I was
still on 1.1.9.1).

I'm trying to create a web site that I can use as a resume to show I can use
C# and ASP.NET on both Linux and Windows, and it's really frustrating when
the whole thing keeps breaking.  I'm also trying to show I can use
PostgreSQL or SQL Server 2000 for the back end database.  I'm also trying to
make the web site somewhat useful by making it into a searchable database of
Iowa legislators (the official state web site doesn't have the functionality
I'm going to add to mine).

Thank you, again!

Carl

The lesson is 'we need you to make mono better' ;-).

The bug you reported was already fixed in svn head.

We know that 1.1.9 had a lot of problems in system.web, as there was a
major rewrite of several thousand lines. Since 1.1.9, I've been fixing
all the reported regressions as fast as I could. If you use
System.Web.dll from head
(<A HREF="http://primates.ximian.com/~gonzalo/System.Web.dll.gz">http://primates.ximian.com/~gonzalo/System.Web.dll.gz</A>) you'll see that
we're pretty much back to where we were in 1.1.8.x, i.e., no known
showstoppers. If you and others didn't report all the bugs you found, we
wouldn't be here.

I hope that the trouble we caused with the rewrite is compensated with
the improved performance and memory usage we got. I still have to blog
some numbers about this, but it's a big win.

Cheers.
