<PRE>Hello Oleg,

I was just finding for HttpListener information and came across
your post (several months late); I think it would be nice if this
code could be part of our System.dll.

If you have an updated module, can you please post it again? If
you are not working on it, we can just take over the development.

If you are still on development, I'd ask some things to modify
the code:

	- We use Latin1 for our mcs source code (actually having
	  only ASCII characters is the best for all non-Latin1 people).
	- Code formatting: We have different coding style than VS.NET
	  default.
	  <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines">http://www.mono-project.com/Coding_Guidelines</A>
	- It would be better if such sources that are in &quot;Classes&quot;,
	  &quot;Threading&quot; and &quot;Collections&quot; are renamed as something like
	  Mono.HttpListener.Impl, or just be inside System.Net.
	- Actually I guess some classes could be unified to single
	  static utility class (such as CharCode.cs and
	  HeaderEncoding.cs).
	- If it is updated to 2.0 RTM API, that would be awesome :-)
	  Now we implemented more 2.0 stuff than we used to have
	  in February.
	- I also wrote some tiny missing bits for HttpListener
	  (actually the HttpListener and related classes themselves
	  but it was not done) attached, in case you don't have.

Many thanks for offering your code for us :-)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you know, fast XML parsers exists in 2 ideologies: event-based and

</I>&gt;<i> different ideologies for HTTP library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> XSP (as well as Cassini) is mostly 'event-based'. There are workingthreads that polls sockets and when request received &#8213; server
</I>&gt;<i> processing started.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At other part, HttpListener is completely 'read-based'. There is
</I>&gt;<i> HttpListener.GetContext method, that 'reads' next request. And all
</I>&gt;<i> threading and processing logic must be done on behalf of caller.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, such 'read-based' doctrine is first important point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Second point is asynchronous processing. There is GetContext and it's
</I>&gt;<i> shadow brothers BeginGetContext and EndGetContext. Easiest way of
</I>&gt;<i> BeginGC/EndGC implementation was using ThreadPool. But it is not good

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When BeginGetContext spawn ThreadPool's thread, that thread just

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, I implement really asynchronous processing for this methods.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Next, third important point is global scope of HttpListener's
</I>&gt;<i> prefixes. HttpListener is prefix-based, not address-based. In
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft's version, you can create:
</I>&gt;<i>   HttpListener1 that listens on &quot;<A HREF="http://localhost/folder1/&quot;">http://localhost/folder1/&quot;</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>   HttpListener2 that listens on &quot;<A HREF="http://localhost/folder2/&quot;">http://localhost/folder2/&quot;</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Theese objects can have completely different lifetime. So, there is
</I>&gt;<i> not trivial task &#8213; separating physical EndPointListener from logical
</I>&gt;<i> prefix-bound HttpListener. My code does this task too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, my current care is cleaning and thread-testing. I'm ready to find
</I>&gt;<i> a number of hidden race conditions.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK. This is all for now. Have a nice day, Miguel.
