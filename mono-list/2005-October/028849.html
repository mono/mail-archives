<PRE>This is a final part of the series :). 
All attempts to fix the mono build by changing the
ldscript to remove VER_1 tag on my current Linux
install failed. I finally decided to test build
process on the freshly installed linux. I scratched
installation and reinstalled SUSE Linux 10 RC1.
Installation did not include Apache and GNOME, other
than that it is a standard set. I redownloaded sources
of monoXX9.1 and run ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
in the source dir. Success as before. make failed
exactly like I reported in my original e-mail. Fixing
ldscript leads to make success, but make install fails
in [make 8]  mono-api-info.exe with segmentation
fault.

Seems unlikely that this problem is attributed to the
package(s) included in the latest SUSE and required by
mono. I will appreciate any help to solve the build process.
