<PRE>* Jonathan Pryor:

&gt;<i> This won't work with a great deal more than just Mono applications.
</I>&gt;<i> This will likely also &quot;break&quot; for every app that uses a runtime (Java,
</I>&gt;<i> Perl, Python),
</I>
It doesn't break for Perl or Python, nor Emacs or vi.

&gt;<i> and certainly won't work with GTK+/Gnome applications
</I>&gt;<i> unless the user explicitly sets the G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment
</I>&gt;<i> variable to contain the character set name that should instead be used
</I>&gt;<i> (and how many users will know about G_FILENAME_ENCODING, much less set
</I>&gt;<i> it?), or the user sets G_BROKEN_FILENAMES=1.
</I>
I just tested gedit.  It can access such files even without setting
those environment variables.  The file selection dialog warns that the
encoding is invalid.

&gt;&gt;<i> A first step in a direction to fix that would be to use native strings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (multibyte strings) for accessing native APIs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does that mean, exactly?  Mono is already generating multibyte
</I>&gt;<i> strings for the Native APIs -- UTF-8 strings, yes, but UTF-8 is a
</I>&gt;<i> multibyte encoding -- so your statement is effectively meaningless.
</I>
Native strings on UNIX are NUL-terminated arrays of bytes.  All
strings interpreted by the operating system (mainly file system paths)
are of this form.  At some point, you have to make a conversion.  I
hope that Mono will expose the byte strings in its Mono.Unix API
because the functionality you can implement using byte strings is a
strict superset of what is possible if you only permit UTF-16 strings.

(There is also a possibility to encode invalid byte strings (which are
not valid UTF-8) using invalid surrogate sequences, but this is kludge
and has potential security implications, as the conversion from UTF-16
to UTF-8 can suddenly produce invaldi UTF-8 sequences.)

&gt;<i> It sounds like what you *really* want is for Mono's string marshaler to
</I>&gt;<i> marshal to the user's preferred character set/encoding instead of UTF-8.
</I>
No, this is not what I want.  I want to be able to write code which
can access all files the user has read access to, irrespective of
their names.
