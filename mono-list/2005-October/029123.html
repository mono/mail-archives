<PRE>I upgraded from 1.1.9.1 to 1.1.9.2 yesterday.  When I upgraded from 1.1.8 to
1.1.9.1, the datagrid control was badly broken, so I kept filing bug reports
until all of the stuff was working again.  Now, upgrading from 1.1.9.1 to
1.1.9.2 has caused it to break again (selected index returns -1 for every
datarow).  I consider an upgrade from 1.1.9.1 to 1.1.9.2 to be a minor
version upgrade.  You are referring to an upgrade from 1.1.8 to 1.1.9 which
would be a major version upgrade.  I still don't understand why it has to
break on a minor version upgrade.

I'm trying to develop a web site that needs to be working by January.  I
started working on it at least two months ago, but every time I find some
time to work on it, something is broken again and I spend all my time filing
bug reports instead of working on the site.

I guess the lesson here is that I should have stuck with 1.1.7 which shipped
with SUSE 9.3.

Thanks for the reply!

Carl

Large parts of System.Web have been rewritten between 1.1.8 and 1.1.9.
What you see are the aftereffects.
