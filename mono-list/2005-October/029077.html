This won't work with a great deal more than just Mono applications.
This will likely also &quot;break&quot; for every app that uses a runtime (Java,
Perl, Python), and certainly won't work with GTK+/Gnome applications
unless the user explicitly sets the G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment
variable to contain the character set name that should instead be used
(and how many users will know about G_FILENAME_ENCODING, much less set
it?), or the user sets G_BROKEN_FILENAMES=1.

A &quot;fix&quot; might be for Mono's string marshaler and
Marshal.StringToHGlobalAnsi() to follow G_FILENAME_ENCODING instead of
always converting to UTF-8 (something I considered a few months ago but
never got around to writing a patch for), in which case things would
work properly for you...if you remembered G_FILENAME_ENCODING, anyway.

&gt;<i> A first step in a direction to fix that would be to use native strings

</I>
What does that mean, exactly?  Mono is already generating multibyte
strings for the Native APIs -- UTF-8 strings, yes, but UTF-8 is a
multibyte encoding -- so your statement is effectively meaningless.

It sounds like what you *really* want is for Mono's string marshaler to
marshal to the user's preferred character set/encoding instead of UTF-8.
This can be done, though I'm not sure what all it would impact, and
determining what the user's preferred encoding is would likely fall to
using G_FILENAME_ENCODING, in which case few may benefit anyway.
