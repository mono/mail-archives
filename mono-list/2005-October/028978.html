<PRE>Hi,

I've mentioned before that I was doing an MSc to which mono would, 
hopefully, be central.  After some toing and froing between me, my tutor 
and the academic co-ordinator, my project proposal has finally been 
agreed.  It isn't quite the project I had in mind when I made my 
original submission, but I have to agree that it is, in many ways, 
better for having been subjected to a fair bit of scrutiny.

Anyway, for anyone who's interested I've started a blog on which I hope 
to record my experiences and successes/failures as the project 
progresses.  So far it contains only my accepted proposal and a request 
for resources presented to my place of work.  The URL of the blog is 
<A HREF="http://peredur.blog.co.uk">http://peredur.blog.co.uk</A>

All comments and suggestions are welcome, although I can't promise to 
reply to everyone.  It depends on how much pressure I'm under :)

Thanks for your attention.

Peter
