<PRE>Hi All,
  I have been trying to upgrade to beta2 for my web applications with limited 
success (they worked just fine in beta1, using xsp standalone, and mod_mono).  
I made sure that I completely removed all old pieces of the beta1 install.  I 
was wondering if anyone else has been running into these same issues, or if I 
have a misconfiguration somewhere.  If not, I will add to bugzilla.

&lt;SystemInfo&gt;
arch: x86  (athlonXP)
distro: Gentoo
kernel: 2.6.6 
glibc (w/ nptl): glibc-2.3.3
gcc: gcc 3.3.2
icu: 2.6
apache: 2.0.49
mono: beta2 (mono-0.95)
xsp: beta2 (xsp-0.14)
mod_mono: beta2 (mod_mono-0.10)
install prefix (mono, xsp, mod_mono): /usr/local
&lt;/SystemInfo&gt;
..please let me know if there is any more info that might help.

The following are the odd bits I have experienced:

1. SharpZipLib
When running XSP and trying to access the webapp the first time, it reported 
that it could not resolve a dependency from ByteFX.Data, namely SharpZipLib.  
The app compiled fine without any special work, however, when running the app 
we do get this error.  Note: I recompiled it fresh with the beta2 release.  I 
was able to work around this by copying in the SharpZipLib dll into the 
webapp /bin directory.  Have I configured something wrong, or is this a bug?

2. mod_mono and XSP hang
I have run into some strange behavior where both mod_mono and XSP hang after a 
few http requests.  By hang, when I make a request, the browser continues 
trying to get the response, but it never comes.  This typically leaves a 
partially rendered page with (usually) images missing, though sometimes there 
is no response at all for a request.  Unfortunately no exception comes 
either, and to kill XSP, I am forced to hit Ctrl-C (enter does not work after 
the hang).  

I thought it might be thread/nptl related, so I upgraded from glibc 2.3.2 to 
glibc 2.3.3, but the problem persisted.

I then tried modifying my apache configuration to use &quot;AddHandler 
mono .aspx .ascx .asax .ashx .asmx .cs .config&quot; rather than &quot;SetHandler 
mono&quot;, and much to my surprise, it worked!  Based on this configuration, all 
content files will be served through apache, without mod_mono getting in the 
way.  Is there something I have incorrectly configured (either mod_mono or 
xsp or system deps)?  Ideally I would be able to use apache/mod_mono for my 
&quot;production&quot; environment, and XSP for development.

Not sure if this is helpful, but it is how I start XSP:
mono /home/mmorano/xsp-0.14/server/xsp.exe --verbose --port 8888 
--appconfigfile /home/mmorano/code/webapp/mono.webapp 
--root /home/mmorano/code/webapp/production

and this is my apache config (either SetHandler or AddHandler is commented 
out):

DocumentRoot /path/to/website
MonoExecutablePath &quot;/usr/local/bin/mono&quot;
MonoServerPath &quot;/usr/local/bin/mod-mono-server.exe&quot;
MonoApplications &quot;/:/path/to/website&quot;
MonoApplicationsConfigFile &quot;/path/to/website/mono.webapp&quot;
MonoDocumentRootDir &quot;/path/to/website&quot;

&lt;Directory /path/to/website&gt;
    #SetHandler mono
    AddHandler mono .aspx .ascx .asax .ashx .asmx .cs .config
    &lt;IfModule mod_deflate.c&gt;
      SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;
    DirectoryIndex index.aspx
    Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    &lt;IfModule mod_access.c&gt;
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/Directory&gt;


Thoughts?

Thanks,
  Mike
