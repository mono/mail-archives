<PRE>Just thought I should mention this,

If there is anyone out there who was previously using the IR =
WebControls, and has not been tainted by their source (e.g. I've only =
ever used the binary distributable while it was available), and is =
interested in working on a free re-implementation of the library please =
let me know.

As I said earlier I started working on re-implementing the assembly off =
the ms docs about it that were online. I've never looked at the acedemic =
(or other) licensed source of the original library and have made =
substantial progress into the TabStrip and MultiPage controls (and all =
the framework classes needed to support it).

I've got it so that the TabStrip renders and operates in down-level =
browser mode properly (i.e. post's back for each tab click) but never =
got round to implementing the platform neutral version of the up-stream =
dynamic behaviour.

I've also got the Multipage rendering in down-level browser mode, but =
still need a little more work to hook up the MultiPage control to the =
TabStrip.

Most of the work was done on this library over a year ago, but since =
then I've been side tracked with other things both oss (MonoDevelop) and =
personal... Actually mostly personal.

If anyone wants to pick up the code and run with it to complete the =
re-implementation I'd be quite happy to pass it on. I'm open to the kind =
of oss license it is to use also.

Regards,

JBA

It seems that I'm not the only one playing with the IE WebControls.  My =
problem is that I haven't figured the right incantations to install it.

I tried:
mono /usr/bin/gacutil.exe /i ./Microsoft.Web.UI.WebControls.dll /f =
/package 1.0 /root /usr/lib

I get:

ERROR: assembly has no valid public key token.

I'm trying this because MD (r1664) blows up when it can't find the dll =
on opening a project or in the import of a VS proj.

With each day that I'm playing with mono, it is making more sense and =
working better.

I agree, mono rocks.  Hopefully I'll be able to finish porting our =
application over to mono.
