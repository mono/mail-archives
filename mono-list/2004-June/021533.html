<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> &gt; I will be giving a presentation to my local LUG introducing them to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mono. Does anyone else have a set of slides and/or demos that will show
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; off features that mono can do that MS.NET doesn't, or good visual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features of mono?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have any slides, but here's an idea for what &quot;mono can do that
</I>&gt;<i> MS.NET doesn't&quot;: Generics. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, that's not really true -- Microsoft has released a beta for generics
</I>&gt;<i> support, as has Mono, but I suspect it's easier to get the mono-preview
</I>&gt;<i> package than the Microsoft beta...
</I>
There are a few other Mono-isms that set it apart from Microsoft's .NET:

	* Supports Sparc Solaris, MacOS X, Linux PPC, IBM S390 with its
	  JIT and HPPA with the interpreter.

	* Open Source: you can reuse chunks of it elsewhere (Compact
	  Framework users are known to pick pieces of our class
	  libraries to reuse them on Windows CE).

	  Plus the standard open source benefits: you can learn, copy,
	  improve, remove, distribute, innovate on your own.

In addition, we also have a series of libraries that happen to work out
of the box with .NET but originated in Mono:

	* Relax NG support.

	* An enhanced crypto stack.

	* Gtk# and associated libraries.

	* Cairo graphics support.

	* Various providers for databases.

And we run a lot of third party components that work both on Windows and
Linux.

Miguel.
