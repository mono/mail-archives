Circular dependencies are notoriously complicated in a statically typed
environment.  The simple answer would be to put both .cs files into the
same assembly, but this isn't apparently what you want to do.

Paolo could answer this better, but I would imagine that assemblies are
demand-paged from disk -- only the parts of the assembly that you
actually use are loaded, so I don't see any reason to not put everything
into the same assembly.

I'm not sure what you mean by import/include, but I imagine it's related
to your questions below, so hopefully my answers below will help.

</I>
It sounds like you want a highly dynamic environment, in which existing
code can be changed at runtime, with older code silently invoking newer
code.

I don't believe it's possible, or at least easily possible, to do this
in C#.  This sounds more like something System.Reflection.Emit and a
custom compiler would be useful for.  That way, you could ensure fast
compile time, and you could come up with a custom way for pre-existing
code to invoke newer code without requiring recompilation (interfaces
might be good for this).

I would suggest looking into IronPython, which is a Python
implementation for .NET.  This may be an easier migration path for you,
assuming you can actually get your hands on it (it's currently a
&quot;unreleased research prototype&quot;, but the author might be willing to
help; I have no idea...).
