First, I love this. It looks *GREAT*. Even if none of these comments are
acted upon, it will still be great.

Now, for comments:

- The orange developers section looks way too bright. Todd commented on
IRC that the using section green had once been bright but was changed. I
think a similar change for the orange would be good.

- On the home page, the XML button does not match the blue color theme.

- Without JavaScript, there seems to be no way to navigate the menu
system.

- On the `Contact Us' button at the top, I expected to see IRC contact
information, and a link for bugzilla. Also, a link to the mailing list
page would be nice.

- <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/about/mailing-lists.html:">http://www.mono-project.com/about/mailing-lists.html:</A>
  - mono-list is missing
  - Could we cut down on the size of the mono-devel-list description. It
makes lots of stuff go below the fold

- <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html">http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html</A>
      * We should have an `older releases' page that has everything
        before, say, beta 1.
      * It might make sense to group like:
                Source
                	...
                Red Hat
                	Red Hat Linux 9
                	Fedora Core 1
                SUSE
                	...
                Windows
                	...
                Mac OS
                	...
                I think that would create less visual clutter.
      * Does Fedora have its own logo? Should we use it rather than Red
        Hat's.
      * Does anyone need a (tm)?

- The team page does not look as professional as everything else. Could
we have a redesign of that to match the rest. Also, on this page the
`tab' thingy at the top has a large gap below it.

- In the menu system, there needs to be a sort of `you are here'
indicator. For example, the current page could be in bold, and would not
be a hyperlink, or it could be a different color etc.

- <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/using/emacs.html">http://www.mono-project.com/using/emacs.html</A> is a dead link

- Where did the whitepaper miguel and I wrote about performance go?

- <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/using/mcs.html">http://www.mono-project.com/using/mcs.html</A> is out of place in the
`using' section. It contains almost nothing about using mcs. IMHO, the
first few paragraphs of text should stay, and we should insert links to
reference articles.

- In the menu system, you are inconsistantly using Title Caps and
Sentence caps. For example:
      * Mono and Gtk# tutorials
      * The Mono Runtime
      * CVS Write access (this one has BOTH methods!)

Just pick one and stay with it.

- <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/compiling.html">http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/compiling.html</A> does not have
`make bootstrap' documented

- <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/about/applications.html">http://www.mono-project.com/about/applications.html</A> should be updated.
For example, MonoDevelop is not on there. Also, obsolete programs (eg,
the debugger, which is now inside MD) should be removed. It would be
nice if the screenshots were all taken using Ximian's industrial theme.

- I saw some instances of GTK#. It is Gtk#.

Ok, I think that's all for now!
