<PRE>Mono.Data.SybaseClient is modeled after the System.Data.SqlClient
provider.   Both use Mono.Data.Tds.
The System.Data.SqlClient support is good because people have been
maintaining it.  Unfortuantely, people have not been maintaining the
parts of the TDS protocol which works for Sybase.

I would look at freetds and jtds to see what's going on.  Use my
favorite debug tool Console.WriteLine().

Alternatives:
1. You could use our System.Data.OleDb or GDA# (found in GTK#) and
libgda to connect to freetds.
2. An interesting alternative to try is use the jtds JDBC provider on
IKVM running on Mono.

What problems are you having with Mono.Data.SybaseClient?

Subject: [Mono-list] ADO.NET plans for Mono 1.0


Hi,

Can somebody tell me what are the plans for ADO.NET regarding the
functionnalities that will be supported in Mono 1.0, particulary for
ODBC and SybaseClient ? Will there be any &quot;service packs&quot; after 1.0 to
fix bugs ? What efforts are actually put into fixing bugs for these two
adapters?

I am presently trying to use these two adapters in order to access a
Sybase 11.5 database, but I encountered many problems with both (I
filled several bug reports...). I also started looking at the code
myself to see if I can help, but unfortunately time is running against
me.  We presently have an &quot;un-official GO&quot; to develop a new project
using Mono, but a proof of concept has to be done and the database
access is a major part of it.
If I had the choice, I would prefer to use SybaseClient instead of ODBC
since it doesn't require any external tools (such as unixODBC and
freeTDS). But actually, ODBC is the only adapter that works in my
environment, and it has many problems (Resource leaks, connections never
closed, datatypes not supported by the DataReader).

Ideally, what I would like to hear is a clear commitment that at least
one of them will work in Mono 1.0 :-)
I am also interested to hear about any commercial success story with
Mono since it could really help in the acceptance of the platform for
our new project.

Regards
S=E9bas
