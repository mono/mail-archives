<PRE>Short answer. No.

Long answer. Not yet. We started using XSP a few months ago, in that 
time it has come a very long way very quickly. Now it is pretty solid. I 
haven't seen it in a high traffic situation yet but frankly I'm not to 
confident that it's ready. Time will tell of course and I think it will 
definitely get there, I don't feel it is there quite yet but I don't 
think it will be long.
