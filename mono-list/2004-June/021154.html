<PRE>Viva a todos,

Not sure if this is the right list to send this message to but here I go...
:<i>-)
</I>
I recently installed Mono on my Linux box and after some struggle I managed
to get the very basic stuff to work by compiling the mono-0.95.tar.gz and
the mcs-0.95.tar.gz packages. I had to do this as the Mono RPMs for Fedora
were giving me an error that I couldn't resolve without recompiling it:

[<A HREF="mailto:root@sereia">root@sereia</A> mono]# mono
mono: error while loading shared libraries: libmono.so.0: cannot handle TLS
data

I have not seriously developed any software since 1995 and decided to start
learning it again. Before 95 I even developed a programming language based
on Pascal and generating assembler code so I know the basics very well but I
have definitely lost the boat of OOP and GUI programming...

As I would like to come back to some code development but need some practice
that I will not be able to get at work (I work in IT but in support of
networking devices) I would like to add some value and for that matter I
would like to contribute to a open source project that uses mono as the
development tool... Yes, if I'm coming back I want to do it in a clever way
and use the development tools of the future! ;-)

Of course I have some requirements but I believe they are simple to fulfill:
Project with not GUI design and implementation involved that works with a
MySQL database. It can also be developing some parts of a GUI application
but doing work not related to graphical output. If you know of such a
project that needs help please let me know and I will get in touch with the
people involved.

Maybe it would be wise to reply directly to me for not disturbing the rest
of the list any more than I have already done with this message.

Thanks in advance for any help!
