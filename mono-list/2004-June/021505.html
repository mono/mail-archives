Unfortunately this sounds like a lot better of an idea than it really 
is. There are subtle but pervasive differences in the platform itself. 
We have had to extend a lot of non-gui code to meet the requirements of 
mono, gnome, and in general the 'open source' way of writing code. An 
abstract 'IDE backend' is just not feasible on any realistic level. And 
even if you could somehow unify everything into one framework, there 
will still exist people that have issues with one piece or another, and 
will want to write their own stuff.

As far as not having to write code over, all of the code in 
SharpDevelop, and most of the code in MonoDevelop is licensed under the 
GPL, so reuse via copy is a very realizable goal.
