<PRE>Hi everyone!
I was quite intrigued by the chance of having .NET applications also 
run on my beloved iMac, but I'm quite terminalphobic -- so, after 
having seen that .NET exes work on my Mac (yeah!), I've written a small 
starter .app to run exes by double-clicking.

THINGS IT DOES:
  - It works with both mono and ilrun (portable.net).
  - Starts applications in Mac OS X's Terminal.app.
  - Registers .exes and .dlls with cute, shiny, handmade, 
emblazoned-with-mono-logo custom icons, removing that ugly Virtual PC 
icon from them (which is Windows's default icon for exes, just 
stretched to 128x128. Not &quot;redrawn to look good in 128x128&quot;. Just 32x32 
icons stretched to that size. Ugh).
  - Detects &quot;mono&quot; and &quot;ilrun&quot; by watching into common directories 
(/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, /opt/local/bin, 
/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework and so on).
  - If a .NET environment is not detected, it offers the user a chance 
to install Mono or Portable.NET from a PKG (if such a package is put 
into the program's Resources folder) or, if none is available, shows 
links to go-mono.org and dotgnu.org. Which means that the program 
allows for dumb-proof drag'n'drop installation of Mono (by taking 
&quot;extra steps&quot; on first launch as per Apple Human Interface Guidelines).
  - Can be configured to launch X11 along with the Terminal, allowing 
programs that use Windows.Forms or other windowing toolkits to start 
correctly.

THINGS IT DOESN'T DO:
  - The preferences aren't complete yet - they don't disable the &quot;Use 
Mono&quot; or &quot;Use DotGNU&quot; option even when the corresponding piece of 
software isn't available, very possibly leading to bad behavior 
(NullPointerExceptions suddenly finding their way into the Console at 
the very least).
  - It doesn't allow the user to turn off the Terminal -- that is, to 
load the .exe without having the Terminal window show up. Mainly 
because I'm lazy.
  - It doesn't make any coffee.
  - It has no way of intelligently understanding whether a program is 
console-only or uses a windowing toolkit, so you must activate or 
deactivate X11 manually for now.
  - It does not pass any command-line parameters to the .exe being 
started. Again that's because I'm just lazy.

You can find the .app (with no .pkg inside its Resource folder) at 
<A HREF="http://matrixtcg.altervista.org/monostarter.zip">http://matrixtcg.altervista.org/monostarter.zip</A> and source at 
<A HREF="http://matrixtcg.altervista.org/monostarter.src.zip">http://matrixtcg.altervista.org/monostarter.src.zip</A> (pay attention: the 
.xcode project refers to a portable.net.pkg that isn't there for size 
reasons. Just remove it, the program will detect the absence of pkgs in 
the Resources folder and work just fine). I haven't included a license 
in the .zip but I will soon, and it will be GPL.
