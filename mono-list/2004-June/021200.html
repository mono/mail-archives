Ok, here are some nitpicking comments:

Link is a 404

(you need a link checker ;-)

Missing `alt' tag on these images.

You are missing `height' and `width' tags on alot of images. This would
help the layout on the first load.

`search' button should not use javascript, cant use it from lynx etc.

The Mono logo at the top is not centered in the image. There are 18 px
of padding on the top but 20 px on the bottom.

<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/about/rationale.html">http://www.mono-project.com/about/rationale.html</A> has the same &lt;title&gt; as
the home page, but different content. This is confusing. Also, there is
no way to get to that page except for the text link in the main body. It
should be in the nav bar.

I think the search area should look like this:

+-----------------------+  +----+
|<i> Enter search term     |  | Go |
</I>+-----------------------+  +----+

You should use some JS magic to have it so that when you click inside
the text box, the text goes away. There are a few advantages to this
layout:

      * You save space (no header, button is on same line)
      * The search can be more subtle and elegant.

An example of how this has been done successfully is
<A HREF="http://sparknotes.com/.">http://sparknotes.com/.</A>

On the Contact/Downloads/etc bar at the top there is room for another
link. IMHO we should use it. Personally, I would vote for either
`Blogs', `Bugs' or `Mailing lists'.

The buttons at the top (tabs, contact links) should have rollovers.

You should apply Fitts' law to the news stories on the home page: make
the clickable area as large as possible. Right now you can only click
the date of the article (I tried to click the title at first). Really,
you should just be able to click anywhere in the `box' around the
article (sorta like the menu items)

The `Mono Status' sidebar does not seem right. The different colors
because of linking makes it very weird.

When I open a page such as
<A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/index.html">http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/index.html</A> the menu `flashes'
open. It should not flash on first load.

When you click About Mono / Using Mono / Contributing to Mono, the title
of the page that is opened should be the same as the link you pressed
(it is not for the first two)

The use of of &gt;  as a bullet is very weird. On my box, the gt sign is
too long for this purpose. Really you should use one of the CSS list
types, or your own custom image.

Thats all for now!
