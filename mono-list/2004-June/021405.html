<PRE>Hi again,

I think that some of the points you exposed are valid and are very
interesting. However, the Rhino lexer &amp; parser have together only about
300 lines of code, so that is not *that much* code.

However, it looks like the approach you mentioned could be valid for
other projects that could need it and have a bigger complexity.

Regards,
Carlos.
