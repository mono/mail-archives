<PRE>There is also the issue of Unicode (or lacking) support in Windows 98.

Serge did something to get it to work on Windows 98, such as, including
unicows.dll ? 

Look in the archives of mono-list or mono-devel-list.

Subject: [Mono-list] Windows version does not work on Win98


Hi list
has anyone tried to install Mono 1.0 Beta 2 on Windows 98?
The installer does not fail and nicely tells me that all went well. Then

I have to change the bat-file setmonopath.bat to include &quot; in the PATH 
because Windows 98 does not like the spaces in the PATH-name. But then
the real problem arises. When I start mono or mcs a error 
message pops up and tells me:
    The PSAPI.DLL file is linked to missing export NTDLL.DLL:_stricmp
This looks like the lot is compiled for NT or higher iso Windows 98 
(sorry, I still only have Windows 98 and would love to move to Linux but

that still program calling it self Progress does not work on Linux as a 
client (GUI) so I'm stuck)
I'd love either to see this solved by seeing a version for Windows 98 or

at least that the installer checks what version of Windows I have and 
then say sorry to me and that this setup is only for WinNT/2000/XP and 
up(?). Maybe offer to go on anyway, but at least warn,
Seeing that .NET by M$ does work on Windows 98, it would be nice if Mono

would also work on Windows 98. I understand that there might not be as 
high a demand for that but a setup that does not check for the right 
version of Windows is just not very friendly.
Thanks for all the work put in! I find Mono a interesting alternative.
wkr, Gerke
