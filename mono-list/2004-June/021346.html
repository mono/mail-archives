<PRE>&gt;<i> If you run Eclipse inside IKVM it could load mcs.exe as an assembly 
</I>&gt;<i> and call into it directly to do the C# parsing. (ie, it *could* run 
</I>&gt;<i> within a Mono VM).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know whether we want to limit intellisense to only working if 
</I>&gt;<i> Eclipse is running inside IKVM, though. A bridge to the CLR from a 
</I>&gt;<i> generic JVM using only JNI but providing the same capabilities as 
</I>&gt;<i> IKVM, compatibly, would be the holy grail ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
However you could run a process (read mono application) that the C# 
plugin would communicate with and that would tell it what completions 
are. This application could be built using some of the engine work in 
MD (a GUI less MD engine).

&gt;<i> (With regard to your main point, I don't think that anyone would 
</I>&gt;<i> dispute that getting the basic, minimum features working is a higher 
</I>&gt;<i> priority than the advanced flashy ones, but the question originally 
</I>&gt;<i> asked sounded  a lot like &quot;what features do you want?&quot;. It's 
</I>&gt;<i> unsurprising that the answers focused on advanced features. &quot;I want it 
</I>&gt;<i> to *work*&quot; is kind of implied...)
</I>
Well, I wanted to make sure those requirements were clear (C# 1.0, 
platforms, eclipse version and mono/mcs integration.

Once we get that working, the community is likely to pick it up and 
improve it (debugger, form designer, automatic ice cream machine)
