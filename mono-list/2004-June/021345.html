If you run Eclipse inside IKVM it could load mcs.exe as an assembly and 
call into it directly to do the C# parsing. (ie, it *could* run within a 
Mono VM).

I don't know whether we want to limit intellisense to only working if 
Eclipse is running inside IKVM, though. A bridge to the CLR from a 
generic JVM using only JNI but providing the same capabilities as IKVM, 
compatibly, would be the holy grail ;)

(With regard to your main point, I don't think that anyone would dispute 
that getting the basic, minimum features working is a higher priority 
than the advanced flashy ones, but the question originally asked sounded 
  a lot like &quot;what features do you want?&quot;. It's unsurprising that the 
answers focused on advanced features. &quot;I want it to *work*&quot; is kind of 
implied...)
