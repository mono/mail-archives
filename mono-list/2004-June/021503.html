Ok your points are valid and I was not thinking through the human issues 
   in development.

</I>
Can java programs running inside the IKVM utilise .net objects inside 
the CLR (just like VB.net programs talk to C# code and such forth)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> However you could run a process (read mono application) that the C#

If this is the case then might it be an idea to seperate out the backend 
of mono-develop (and in part sharp-develop) and then write front-ends to 
this code, granting us the ability to use the backend stuff with a wide 
variety of platforms and development tools (ie a GTK# front-end, a 
windows frontend , links to emacs / vim eclipse etc), with some 
discussion with the sharp-develop team we could all work against a 
common backend reducing the amount of work involved for all ?!? .
