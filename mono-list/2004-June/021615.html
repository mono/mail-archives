Hi,


Has anyone managed to build Mono 0.96 on Solaris 8 (Sparc) successfully=
?
I've been running into a few problems with 'monoburg' and can't figure =
out
how to fix it.


First - the mono 'make' fails on monoburg.y:

bison ./monoburg.y -o parser.c
make: *** [parser.c] Broken Pipe

(I'm using Bison 1.875d)


I can get around this using Sun yacc:

/usr/ccs/bin/yacc monoburg.y
cp y.tab.c parser.c

But, when I run make again:

./monoburg ./sample.brg &gt; sample.c
ld.so.1: ./monoburg: fatal: libgthread-2.0.so.0: open failed: No such f=
ile
or directory
make: *** [sample.c] Error 137



Has anyone seen this before? Any thoughts or comments on how to fix it
would be greatly appreciated!


Thanks,



Jeff.
