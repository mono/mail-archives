<PRE>Miguel,
        I would just like to get a clarification of your last statement in the 
previous posting on this thread. Are you saying that you are not considering 
any System.Messaging implementation until Mono 2.0 or later (at which time 
Indigo would have been out as 1.0)?

I've got a set of apps that are relying on MSMQ to do async message passing. 
I'd like to have those apps run on Linux or at least under Mono even if it's on 
Windoze. One of the issues that prevents me from doing that is the fact that 
System.Messaging isn't implemented yet and that support for 
System.ServiceProcess &amp; System.Configuration.Install isn't complete. 

I looked at MonoQLE by Rafael Teixeira, but it is in it's infancy, and no 
progress seems to be occuring on it for the last year or so.

Could you please share your vision (and timeline) on these pieces/classlibs?. 
While not crucial to Mono development in general, these could be pretty 
important decisive factors for many developers trying to get their business 
apps ported over.

Regards,
       Mark.

&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sorry miguel, its ever an honnour for me to echange with you, you can 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  find more about spread project on <A HREF="http://www.spread.org">http://www.spread.org</A> (logical, isnt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  it ? or google, the first link i think)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its a big project according to its supported by darpa and nsa ! im not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  very impresive in this subject but as i have  understood, something of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  com+n can be remmappesd with spread !
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one other thing is the ability of a module to do postgrsql replication !
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know enough about the subject to comment on whether it could be
</I>&gt;<i> used to implement EnterpriseServices.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indigo I understand has some of these features also exposed, but I do
</I>&gt;<i> not know how much of it is done in managed mode.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have no plans to support EnterpriseServices for now, and we are
</I>&gt;<i> paying more attention to see what Indigo looks like.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am sorry that I do not have a better answer at this point.
</I>&gt;<i>
