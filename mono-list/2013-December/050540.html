<PRE>I find myself in need of a FifoStream (similar to a MemoryStream, but forward-moving only, and without backing, so the memory that has already been read may be garbage collected.)  While I search around, I find a whole bunch of people out there who have had similar requirements, but they all seem to just implement it themselves, and sometimes they have bugs, and various other problems, etc.

So I'm thinking, since I'm going to have to write it, I'd like to contribute it to some generic library collection, and my question is:

What generic library collections do people use?  Is mono a good place to contribute such a thing?  (I'm discovering recently that it's very easy and highly permissive, to link to Mono assemblies).

I looked at C5, which might be great, but it seemed to have some unexpected external dependencies and lack of documentation, thus some barriers to adoption - which might be worthwhile - but I didn't want to invest the effort without at least first having a clue how good or useful it is...

I looked at powercollections, but similarly, there were some adoption obstacles, which might be totally worthwhile to overcome...

At least with mono, there is little to no obstacle standing in the way of people linking to the libraries.  But maybe there are some other options out there that are even better?
