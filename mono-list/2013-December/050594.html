It&#8217;s sort of tricking you when you run it on the same Windows machine where you built it.  If you copy that same ConsoleApplication2.exe built by MS.NET to a different Windows machine and run it, you will not see the detailed stack trace either.  On a different Windows machine from the one where I built your sample code, I get this minimal stack trace:

System.ApplicationException: Error in the application.
	at ConsoleApplication2.Program.Main(String[] args)

I&#8217;m not sure how MS.NET does this magic, but it&#8217;s really not important - I expect you will run your code on other machines than where you build it.

Jonathan is right that the stack trace is also less detailed because it&#8217;s inlined by the JIT, but this is also the same behavior as MS.NET.  Disabling optimizations would be necessary for either compiler to stop inlining.
