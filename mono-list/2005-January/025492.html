Yes.

That's not XCOPY Deployment, at least as I understand it.

XCOPY deployment is the ability to run an application *without* running
an installer first.  Thus the application is location-independent, and
deploying (installing) to another machine is as simple as copying the
application.

Which is basically what Mac OS X Application Bundles allow... :-)

What you want is the ability for xsp to restart the AppDomain whenever
it notices that a DLL has changed within the bin directory.  Last I
knew, this wasn't entirely functional as the FileSystemWatcher wasn't
entirely functional.
