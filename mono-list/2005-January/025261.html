</I>&gt;<i>parsing of the source tree, so that I can manipulate the methods as
</I>&gt;<i>they're in memory. However, I can't seem to find simple ways to navigate
</I>&gt;<i>through the memory representation of the source tree. Can anyone give me
</I>&gt;<i>a brief pointer to where I should be looking?

</I>Use System.Reflection to read available methods, attributes and 
properties for a dll. You can use it to do so at runtime. I know there 
has been a few questions and answers on Relection in the archives
