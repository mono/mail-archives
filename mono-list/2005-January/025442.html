<PRE>Hi!

I just wanted to let you know that support for Mono in X-develop is 
coming along nicely. More details below...

Introduction

X-develop is a cross-platform multi-language IDE supporting the C#, 
VB.net and Java programming languages and the MS .NET, Mono and Java 
VMs. Our main focus are code-centric features such as on-the-fly project 
checking, refactoring, smart templates, etc.

More information is available from <A HREF="http://www.x-develop.com.">http://www.x-develop.com.</A>

State

The X-develop Preview version is already quite usable and even though 
there are a few rough edges remaining we think that it can be used for 
serious programming already.

Mono support

When the first preview version of X-develop was released our support for 
Mono was in its infancy it has much improved since:

* Support for Mono on Windows. Installed Mono frameworks are 
automatically detected.

* Autodetection of installed Mono frameworks on Linux in common 
locations. If X-develop does not work out-of-the-box with packages for 
your distribution please report.

* Customizable configuration in the Integration ¦ Mono section of the 
Preferences Dialog.

* Support for building VS.net 2003/2005 projects with mcs and mbas on 
Windows and Linux.

* Easy switching between different framework versions during development 
(Mono 1.0/2.0 branch, MS.net frameworks on Windows)

* We are currently prototyping a Mono debugger using the Mono.Debugger 
managed API.


A free preview version is available for download. If you have any 
questions regarding X-develop or problems getting it to work with Mono 
please let me know.


Best regards,


Hans
