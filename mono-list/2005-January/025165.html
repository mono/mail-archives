<PRE>Erik,

If I understand your response correctly, in order to access COM calculators =
that I currently have, I would also need to be running the COM runtime on the=
 =
UNIX host. If this is true then it sound like my only option would be to port=
 =
the calculators to UNIX. I was looking to use MONO as a cross platform bridge=
 =
to allow me to get to these COM servers without having to port them to UNIX. =
Are there any vendors providing COM on UNIX that your aware of=3F

Regards,
Scott L. Robik

No we do not. There is no reliable COM implementation on UNIX to =20
interface with.
