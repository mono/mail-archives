Well, there wouldn't be a lot of #if statements, as far as I know. A
failure of the preconditions indicates that there's a bug in your user's
code. A failure of the postconditions or invariants indicates that a bug
exists in your code. Because of this, there are really two use cases
(although a bit more fine-grained tuning could be used without requiring
you to be overly verbose).

Firstly, debugging. You want everything on. That way, you can ensure
that your code is working as expected. If any postconditions or
invariants fail, you know that your code is not holding up its end of
the bargain..

The second case is in release code. You want only preconditions on. The
postcondition and invariant checks will probably be too slow to use in
release code, and by that time you've already (theoretically) debugged
your application. Unit testing combined with postconditions/invariants
should discover a significant number of those bugs, and give you the
confidence to disable them. Preconditions, however, would still be
enabled. Since most functions already put lines in the beginning of
functions anyways to test variable constraints, this would simply shift
the placement of these tests from code to metadata.

</I>
I'm not quite sure if this kind of approach would work. Design By
Contract explicitly states when contracts need to be checked, so having
an external application that does process-time checking would be
difficult to implement in this way.

Also, preconditions are something you (almost) always want checked, so
requiring a third-party application in this case seems even worse than a
third-party library. Especially so, because any libraries which
implement Design By Contract would then be forced to redistribute the
application, and their clients would be forced to run it.

In all, I want to avoid having to write a bottom-up parser for C#, or
even rip out mcs' C# parser, and use it for my own needs. Is there some
method of putting hooks into mcs, so that I don't have to modify the mcs
code itself?
