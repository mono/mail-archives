<PRE>Hola

&gt;<i> &gt; I was wondering, does this work on a debian system?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what about apt-get , will this not conflict? I might install stuff that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; apt-get already installed and vice versa
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The packages have been built against the least common denominator, so it
</I>&gt;<i> should work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only downside of BitRock is that it does not participate in the
</I>&gt;<i> package management infrastructure available in your system. 
</I>
That could also be considered a &quot;feature&quot; :) 
The installer does not require root access to install, allows multiple
simultaneous installations, the same binary can work across multiple
distributions.

We do not intend to replace compiling from source or rpm for those users
that feel comfortable with it, but offer an alternative to those that for
whatever reason have trouble getting Mono up and running.

&gt;<i> Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> something that could be added to BitRock though.
</I>
We could add that functionality, but I need to understand better what you
are looking for, so we can look for ways to implement that functionality

registering with the RPM database after installation?
(which problem would that solve?)

detecting any external dependencies? since it is mostly self contained, right
now this would be gtk and mozilla for monodevelop.


Best regards

Daniel
