It is excellent. I did not face any problems regarding postgresql support in 
mono.
For LDAP I did face a few issues, I reported them in bugzilla.  Within 2 days 
I realised I am facing a problem, I wrote a bug report, a fix arrived, I 
downloaded the updates from svn and I was running without a problem 
(everything within 2 days). Mono team is doing great.

It appears to be good. Not heard any sucessstories as yet. If you know any 
please post them here.
I am in the process of migrating a business critical live site for a client. I 
will be concentrating on using mono in the best possible way. Unfortunately 
this client has used more microsoft technologies than microsoft could have 
ever used for its own site.

Any successstories regarding VB.NET will be helpful to build my confidence and 
in turn me building the clients confidence in mono.
