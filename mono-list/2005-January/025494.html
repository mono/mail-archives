<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Is mono supposed to support xcopy deployment?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have to restart xsp (actually apache2 with mod_mono) 
</I>&gt;<i> everytime I add 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a new dll to my ./bin/ directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's not XCOPY Deployment, at least as I understand it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> XCOPY deployment is the ability to run an application 
</I>&gt;<i> *without* running an installer first.  Thus the application 
</I>&gt;<i> is location-independent, and deploying (installing) to 
</I>&gt;<i> another machine is as simple as copying the application.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What you want is the ability for xsp to restart the AppDomain 
</I>&gt;<i> whenever it notices that a DLL has changed within the bin 
</I>&gt;<i> directory.  Last I knew, this wasn't entirely functional as 
</I>&gt;<i> the FileSystemWatcher wasn't entirely functional.
</I>
So what you're saying is &quot;Mono is supposed to support xcopy deployment, but
currently doesn't&quot;?

Any member of the Mono team like to give a definative answer about this?

Chris
