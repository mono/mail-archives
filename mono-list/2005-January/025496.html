</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That's not XCOPY Deployment, at least as I understand it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; XCOPY deployment is the ability to run an application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *without* running an installer first.  Thus the application is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; location-independent, and deploying (installing) to 
</I>&gt;<i> another machine 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is as simple as copying the application.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What you want is the ability for xsp to restart the AppDomain 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; whenever it notices that a DLL has changed within the bin 
</I>&gt;<i> directory.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Last I knew, this wasn't entirely functional as the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; FileSystemWatcher wasn't entirely functional.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So what you're saying is &quot;Mono is supposed to support xcopy 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deployment, but currently doesn't&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think what he is saying is that mono *does* support Xcopy 
</I>&gt;<i> deployment but what you are asking about is something else 
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't work properly at the moment.  Although I am not 
</I>&gt;<i> quite sure what the problem with FileSystemWatcher is as I 
</I>&gt;<i> have been using it for quite some time now.
</I>
Having reviewed my config files, I now have xcopy deployment up &amp; running (I
thought I had seen it working before).

Now I feel stupid - still, its something I'll look out for again!

Thanks All

Chris
