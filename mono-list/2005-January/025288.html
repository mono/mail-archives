Hi Folks:

I have made both blog entries and replied to our mailing lists about the 
subject of Mono/Gtk# Development in Windows.

There are some resources in the month of  September 2004 of my blog: 
<A HREF="http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/archives/2004_09.html">http://www.mfconsulting.com/blog/archives/2004_09.html</A>
Sep 15 is pretty good.

As far as MonoDoc on Win32.  There some things that we are trying right 
now.  But it will probably be best once we have a Gtk# friendly  HTML 
rendering control available for Mono/Gtk# in Win32. In the mean time, 
you can use the mono-project.com on-line documentation at:
<A HREF="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/">http://www.go-mono.com/docs/</A>

You could also use Mono-1.1.3 installer for Win32 (if you have the hard 
drive space you can install it in the same machine that Mono 1.0.5 is 
installed without disruption) and launch the included XSP Test Web 
Server that is on the menu created by the installer and followed by 
selecting the XSP Index Page menu option

Say you were using Mozilla (IE has some issues with the relative URL) or 
FireFox and you go to the provided <A HREF="http://localhost:8113/monodoc.ashx">http://localhost:8113/monodoc.ashx</A> 
and this would show you the equivalent of MonoDoc's right pan (the 
selected topic's content) .  A draw back of this is that I don't have a 
Tree control that display the Index.  However you could look for 
something specifically like:

<A HREF="http://localhost:8113/monodoc.ashx?link=N:Gtk">http://localhost:8113/monodoc.ashx?link=N:Gtk</A>

which would give you all of the Gtk# Namespace

or

<A HREF="http://localhost:8113/monodoc.ashx?link=T:Gtk.HBox">http://localhost:8113/monodoc.ashx?link=T:Gtk.HBox</A>

for all things relating to the Horizontal Box widget.

The only advantage to this form of access to MonoDoc in Win32 over the 
preferred docs on-line at the project's website is that you can be 
disconnected (no connection to the Internet) and still have good 
document rendering and even printing capabilities :)

Hope this help

Paco
