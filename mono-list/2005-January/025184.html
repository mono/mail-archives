<PRE>I'm very sorry I keep posting to this group with the same problem, but 
I'm really having great difficulty setting up a working mono 
environment.  If I'm getting on everyone's nerves I'd be grateful if 
you'd tell me that as kindly as you can, and I'll take the hint and go away.

The history is that I've installed mono (version 1.0.1) from the SuSE 
9.2 Pro DVD.  In order to get monodevelop installed, I've then installed 
the following SuSE 9.2 packages from the go-mono site:
*  gecko-sharp-0.6-1
*  gtksourceview-sharp-0.5-1
*  monodoc-1.0.5-1
* monodevelop-0.5.1-1
* xsp-1.0.1-1

When I then tried to install bytefx-data-mysql-1.0.1-1, YaST tells me 
that mono-core is not available - even though it is.

I then tried to get rid of everything and start again.  I used the 
following command from Paul Johnson's web site:

rpm -e mono-ms-extras mono-core-devel mono-locale-other mono-complete mono-remoting 
mono-peapi mono-data-postgresql mono-ziplib mono-posix mono-locale-mideast mono-data-sqlite
mono-cairo mono-web-services mono-novell-directory mono-drawing mono-data mono-winforms
mono-nunit mono-ikvm mono-data-oracle mono-runtime-devel mono-ms-enterprise mono-directory
mono-core mono-web-forms mono-preview mono-locale-rare mono-complete-devel mono-xml-relaxng
mono-locale-cjk mono-basic monodoc gtk-sharp xsp monodevelop gtksourceview-sharp ibm-data-db2
ikvm gtk-sharp-gapi gecko-sharp bytefx-data-mysql mono-data-sybase cairo cairo-devel 
libpixman libpixman-devel

However, this fails to recognize (and therefore uninstall) any of the 
packages installed from the SuSE DVD.  Consequently when I try to 
install from downloaded packages (1.0.1 or 1.0.5) I just get lots of 
dependency errors.

What I need to finish up with is sufficient packages installed that I 
can install and run n-tier, distributed ASP.NET applications using MySQL 
as a backend database.  This implies I need the MySQL data components, 
all the available remoting facilities and Web application facilities.  
I've pretty much given up on the idea of using Linux (i.e. mono on 
Linux) as a development platform, except for tutorial/self-teaching 
purposes.

Is there anyone with the knowledge and patience to explain to me in 
words of one syllable what I have to do?

Thanks in advance

Peter
