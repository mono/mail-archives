</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; XCOPY deployment is the ability to run an application

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is location-independent, and deploying (installing) to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another machine is as simple as copying the application.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What you want is the ability for xsp to restart the AppDomain 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whenever it notices that a DLL has changed within the bin 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory.  Last I knew, this wasn't entirely functional as

I think what he is saying is that mono *does* support Xcopy deployment
but what you are asking about is something else that doesn't work
properly at the moment.  Although I am not quite sure what the problem
with FileSystemWatcher is as I have been using it for quite some time
now.
