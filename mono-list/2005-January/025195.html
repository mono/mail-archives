<PRE>Hi Guys,

I decided to build mono from source since there are no rpms for fc3 on the
go-mono site.  I have a few questions that came up during my attempt:

1)	[This is a total Linux newbie question] I downloaded Mono Runtime
1.0.5(mono-1.0.5.tar.gz), ran it through tar, changed to the  mono-1.0.5
directory and built it as per the instructions in the README file.  I did
not get any errors.  Can I now delete the mono-1.0.5 directory that was
created by tar?  I think the answer is “yes” since I used &quot;./configure
--prefix=/usr/local&quot; which I believe is used by &quot;make install&quot; to put all
the binaries into /usr/local .



2)	I downloaded  Mono Class Libraries and C# Compiler 1.0.5
(mcs-1.0.5.tar.gz) and read the INSTALL.txt.  There is a NOTICE section
that states:

*	Unless you are developing the class libraries, you should   *
*	not need to do any build steps in this directory.           *
*                                                                   *
*       Go to ../mono and read the README file to compile and       *
*       install.                                                    *
*                                                                   *
*       ../mono is where you have your `mono' source download

I’m not planning on developing the class libs but will need to use them in
my C# programs.  I went to the mono-1.0.5 directory that I untarred in
question one above but did not see any README file other than the one that
I used to install mono-1.0.5 and there is no mention of how to install the
class libs.  I did look in /usr/local/  and found mcs in /usr/local/bin 
but I don’t know where to look to see if the Mono Class Libraries where
installed when I installed mono-1.0.5.  My guess is they were not so I’m
trying to understand how to install &quot;Mono Class Libraries and C# Compiler
1.0.5 (mcs-1.0.5)&quot;..... so, do I need to install mcs-1.0.5, if so then
how?



3) I tried to install Gtk# 1.0.4 but ran into an error during the make
&quot;./configure --prefix=/usr/local&quot;.  Something about adding the directory
containing `mono.pc’ to
PKG_CONFIG_PATH.  I think this is a result of not installing mcs-1.0.5 in
question 2 but I don’t know.



Thanks for any help.

-Kevin
