<PRE>Hi everyone,

I am developing a Web Service with mono, that relies on a C++ backend.
I have wrapped the C++ component with SWIG without many problems, and
the C# test program seems to be working, as long as I place the shared
objects with the native code in the lib folder corresponding to my
local mono installation prefix. Nothing unexpected here.

The actual problem has appeared when deploying the service itself. I
know that the assemblies, which the service depends on, must be placed
on a folder named 'bin' at the same folder as the service .asmx file
is located.

However, this does not work: a System.DllNotFoundException is raised
as soon as the C# code invokes the constructor. It seems to methat the
native code shared objects must be placed somewhere 'special' - if I
am not misunderstanding the exception meaning, the run-time symbol
dependencies are not being resolved. Where should I place the native
code shared objects? The 'default' location ( where it worked with the
console mono application using the wrapped classes) did not work, as
well as neither did /usr/lib nor /usr/local/lib/mono/1.0 ( my mono
installation prefix was /usr/local).

Thanks in advance,

Miguel Ramírez.
