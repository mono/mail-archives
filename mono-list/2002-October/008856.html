<PRE>Hi James,

I will send the reply also to <A HREF="mailto:mono-list@ximian.com.">mono-list@ximian.com.</A> There are many
people with great ideas on that list ;-)

We already have a profiler, its in mono/mono/metdata/profiler*, but i am
unsure if that is suitable for feedback directed optimizations (i assume
its too slow). I would start measuring simple things like usage count,
and find some additional metrics from IL code analysis.

Our plan is to implement a 2 phase jit, but so far we have no code. So
we are also interested in gathering some statistics about usage count,
time spent in those methods, ...

AFAIK ORP (the intel java jit) uses a 2 phase compilation technique, 
maybe its interesting to look at there code.
