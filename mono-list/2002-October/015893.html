</I>I have definitely had threading related issues with the XSP web server. 
The code I am trying to port (slowly, it's my spare time) uses the XML 
libraries to XSLT some XML into nice little web pages. The code to do 
this doesn't return from a system call (into the XML lib) until after 
the thread (or whatever) returns with an error. Net result, calls to 
transform XML do not work. NOTE: I haven't tried this in a few weeks so 
it may be fixed.
