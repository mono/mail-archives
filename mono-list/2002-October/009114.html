I would support this approach, *if* potential licensing issues can 
be resolved.  I don't think it would be a good use of resources to 
spend a lot of time porting jTDS only to find out that the licence 
is incompatible.

Of course, if mono people don't mind advertising for the jTDS guys
appearing in mono code, then it probably isn't an issue.  It would
be good if someone could get in contact with the jTDS folks to see
what their take on this is.
