At one point in the past I looked at creating a libgda provider for
FreeTDS.  Unfortunately, I ran out of time :).  I would like to help
create a provider for FreeTDS in mono.  I'm not sure that going through
libgda is the correct approach though.

I do have Windows and Microsoft SQL Server, however I don't see why
developing a SQL Server provider requires development to be done on
Windows.  It would require that the developer have SQL Server available
on a network, but that's all. 

I haven't looked at the FreeTDS source in a while, so I don't know how
difficult it would be to implement a native provider in C#.

Since I'm trying to get back into mono development, I would be
interested in helping out.
