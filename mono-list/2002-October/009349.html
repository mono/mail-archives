<PRE>I concur, which is why I wrote that email. This way somebody else could 
possible get a bit further without having to use time on something that 
have already been done.

I did find someone mentioning that he had something up and running in the 
list archives and tried to contact him - but no response. So maybe some 
activity on the list regarding OSX could bring them forward.

But any progress that I do make will be posted to the list immediatly.
