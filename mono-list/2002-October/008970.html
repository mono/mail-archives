IMHO, every type should have it's own file.  Miguel would probably want every 
member to have it's own file too, but am not sure about that.  Many people 
are clamoring for an msdn like documentation and this would require members 
to be broken out into individual html files, but many others like javadoc 
style...  

So for linking you'd probably have something like &lt;a 
href=&quot;RelativePath/System.Object.html&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/a&gt;

&gt;<i> 2) What sort of output do you want?  Right now, I'm just shoving

</I>&gt;<i>    parseable XML or at the very least presentable CSS/xhtml.
</I>&gt;<i>    Have you got an example of what you want?
</I>
My preference is css/xhtml or compliant css/html ie, it should follow web 
standards and work in all major browsers.

&gt;<i> 3) Where can I find the other XML files?  Is there a DTD or spec
</I>&gt;<i>    or something?  I've only tested against Types.xml.

The monodoc module in cvs.
