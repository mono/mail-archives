<PRE>&gt;<i> The RNG code works on Linux, should work on BSDs, maybe Solaris, and
</I>&gt;<i> won't work on Win32.
</I>
Question 1: Where the code for the RNG ?
The source of both RandomNumberGenerator.cs and RNGCryptoServiceProvider
doesn't return anything.
Are the random function hidden somewhere in the runtime (an not yet called
by the class library) ?

&gt;<i> I'm still a tad confused by the CryptAPI for
</I>&gt;<i> windows.  If you know how to use it to get strong random numbers, have
</I>&gt;<i> at it...
</I>
I've done a quick helper class for CryptoAPI and I can generate chaotic
random at will ;-).
However this is Windows-specific code (as it calls advapi32.dll to access
CryptoAPI).

Question 2: How should this platform specific code be integrated in Mono ?
The helper class (CryptoAPIHelper.cs) and the updated
RNGCryptoServiceProvider.cs will ONLY work on Windows. I don't even have
tried it with Mono (on Windows) - but I will before committing anything on
the list.

Note: There's no rush to make a final decision on this as the helper class
will need to be updated to be used for other &lt;class&gt;CryptoServiceProvider
(like hash, symmetric and asymmetric algorithms).

Doing this I realized that I was about to do something &quot;unconventional&quot; (for
a lack of a better word) in the System.Security.Cryptography namespace. I
was about to limit a class to a specific platform - something that the MS
framework has, kind of, anticiped.

Right now there seems to be a little confusion in the class library about
&lt;class&gt;Managed and &lt;class&gt;CryptoServiceProvider. Mono seems to duplicate the
binary classes present in MS Framework. This is a good thing for
compatibility but by doing so we are breaking the philosophy about
&lt;class&gt;Managed and &lt;class&gt;CryptoServiceProvider.

MS philosophy is (or, from thousand miles east, at least seems to be):
- &lt;class&gt;Managed are classes implemented using 100% managed code (as all
Mono classes seems t be right now - at least before today);
- &lt;class&gt;CryptoServiceProvider are classes that link to an external source
for cryptography (ex: HSM, smartcards or other software library like
CryptoAPI).

IF (and this is an important if) we follow this philosophy this means that
all current classes (which are all 100% managed classes - and I'm really
happy about this) should all be named &lt;class&gt;Managed. The CryptoConfig can
then be modified to return the managed classes as default implementation (so
every &quot;good behavied&quot; application won't see any difference).

The problem is that many current applications (the &quot;un-behavied&quot; ones -
which, by my count, looks like 98%) are directly binding to
&lt;class&gt;CryptoServiceProvider classes (bypassing the CryptoConfig class). In
order to maintain compatibility with these applications (IMHO compatibility
is MUCH more important for Mono than philosophy) we should:

a.    On Windows platform:
        - implement all *CryptoServiceProvider using CryptoAPI. This is
REALLY important for RSA/DSA classes because they store their private key in
CAPI containers (meaning that compatibility will required these classes to
use CryptoAPI).

b.    On Linux (and other platforms):
        - create stubs for every &lt;class&gt;CryptoServiceProvider classes and
map them to the associated &lt;class&gt;Managed. This solution is to ensure
compatibility with software using &lt;class&gt;CryptoServiceProvider classes
directly.
        - later we could provide templates to implement external
cryptographic algorithms. I've experience using PKCS#11 devices and
libraries. So I could develop a PKCS#11 template. My only problem is that,
right now, I dont have any PKCS#11 device to test such a template :-(

The result of this &quot;BIG IF&quot; would be that Mono would have more cryptographic
class than MS (but no more algorithms - unless we want so). However this
wouldn't affect compatibility because:

1. All &lt;class&gt;CryptoServiceProvider would be available (linked to *Managed)
for existing compiled assemblies.
2. Normally &quot;good&quot; software (&lt; 2% but, hopefully, improving) should use
CryptoConfig (or an algorithm base class) to locate an algorithm - which
would return the default implementation (*CryptoServiceProvider, *Managed).

This way both compatibility and philosophy are preserved. ;-)

Question 3:    Any thoughts about this ?
