Well that depends on your standing .... Ximian is a giant of the 
OSS world ... well supplied in money and developers ... They even
have the advantage of voluntary work by hackers.... It is a good 
(almost utopian) economic model for any company. Ximian or Mono
gets for free what MS buys for money.. I'm not saying that the OSS 
guy putting his time into something somebody's going to sell is a 
sucker . But just that mono seems to have a solid economic backing 
from Ximian .It did not just drop out of the sky and charge at MS.
And that too in the lee years of the market. So it is obvious they 
saw some way to recover investment as well as make profit (I don't
know how). So it's not that ludicrous after all.
