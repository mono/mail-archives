<PRE>Hello everyone,

Now that I got my employer's autorization to participate in Mono let me
introduce myself - I'm Sébastien Pouliot and I work as security architect
for Motus Technologies. As part of my work I'm involved in all kind of
security related technologies such as: smart cards, cryptography, PKI and
biometry and I've experience implementing many security standards.

Back in summer 2001 (at the time the .NET framework beta 2 has just been
released), as a project to learn C# and web service, I decided to implement
both a XKMS service and client (<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2001/XKMS/">http://www.w3.org/2001/XKMS/</A>). In order to
use commercial web hosting I had to deploy a 100% managed web service -
which prevented me from using CryptoAPI to generate the X509 certificates.
So I had to roll my own implementation... but that's another story! Anyway
this adventure has led me to work with most classes of the
System.Security.Cryptography.* namespaces.

Ever since I was impressed by C# (which was no surprise since I was a big
Delphi fan) but I didn't have much free time until now to play again with
the technology. But during that time I found out about Mono and begun
following its evolution and frankly I'm quite impressed about all the work
that has been done so far.

For my part, I intend to help in the System.Security.Cryptography.* and in
the Microsoft.WSDK.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates namespaces.

On the bad side this is my first participation in an Open Source project
(and never used CVS or Bugzilla), my UN*X skills predates Linux, my home
development environment is limited to Windows and (it should be obvious by
now) I'm not related to Shakespeare as far as english is concerned. Apart
from that I look like a regular geek ;-)
