<PRE>Well, go ahead, but it still seems brain-dead to be reimplmenting
something that's already done. The space argument is fatuous - have you
ever looked at the memory profile of a running mono app?

Isn't it better to get this stuff running in the most portable way
without duplicating whole chunks of effort just to satisfy some far-off
1% scenario?

Piers.

Thanks for all three options.

&gt;<i> 1) write a small xml parser that handles just the stuff you need in 
</I>&gt;<i> corlib
</I>&gt;<i> 2) (better, IMHO) write an internalcall that uses the GMarkup parser
</I>&gt;<i> in glib and fills in the RSA and DSA structures.
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt; 3) use: Assembly.Load, Activator.CreateInstance &amp; MethodInfo.Invoke
</I>
I would find the reflection stuff much easier but Paolo has a good
point. I've participated in the design and implementation of a hardware
token which included crypto, smart cards and biometry (and I even looked
at how we could get a JVM into that box). I know that I would have hated
any design that didn't minimize dependencies as much as possible (as
such design are often very limited on memory space).

However I would like very much, if possible, that the crypto classes to
be implemented using 100% managed code and I know that some other
classes are gonna require a lightweigth XML parser (probably
CryptoConfig but I've not finished looking at the System.Configuration
classes).

So I will put the small parser on my todo list (unless someone else is
interested :-) and comment the current &quot;bad&quot; code so the tests (and
classes) can be compiled back into mono.

Thanks,
