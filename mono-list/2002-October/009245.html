Hi Alin

Basically, the implementation course I am following is to examine the jTDS code, and port it into C#.  In some cases, there is a direct translation, or even no translation required.  In some other cases, I have changed the code quite a bit.

I'm also referring to the FreeTDS code and documentation in the process,
as a sort of double check.  Since FreeTDS seems to be more active, there is newer information there, so it is more complete; jTDS has the advantage of being in Java, which is much closer to C#, and thus easier to port.

At this point, I'm able to login to MS SQL Server 7.0 and 2000, and run a few queries, etc.

If you are interested in Mono and the TDS client implementation, please feel free to take a look at some of the source code, or give it a try
for yourself.  Any tips that you can offer will be greatly appreciated.
The protocol seems pretty well documented on the FreeTDS site.

I may call upon you if I run into any significant roadblocks.  At this point, I'm pretty happy with the progression, since I've only been working on it for less than a week, and I was sick for three days. :-)
