Yes, this caused me all sorts of problem when I first started making
patches for mono.  The problem is that some files in the repository have
CR/LF endings.  The world only works if the repository files have LF
endings.

The CR/LF translation offered by WinCVS only works by converting LF to
CR/LF when you run &quot;cvs checkout&quot; and converting CR/LF to LF when you
run &quot;cvs checkin&quot;.  So, when the repository file is CR/LF terminated,
the WinCVS conversion gives you CR/CR/LF endings!

If your patch file contains diffs for a mixture of CR/LF and LF-ended
files, then you'll end up getting very frustrated!

One way around this on windows is to use cygwin cvs exclusively.  I
develop almost exclusively on linux now, and also have CVS access so I
haven't suffered problems recently.

The best solution is for some brave soul to run a CR/LF-&gt;LF filter on a
checked-out tree and then commit the results.  That'll fix it once and
for all.  You'd need to use the --ignore-space-change with &quot;cvs diff&quot;
for those files if required for a wee while. But it's the Right Thing To
Do, I think.
