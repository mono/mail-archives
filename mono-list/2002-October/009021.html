<PRE>I found this on Mono'w web site about needing cyrtography support in Mono.
What about using Netscape Security Services?

<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/overview.html">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/overview.html</A>

The only problem I see with using NSS is that it uses NSPR (Netscape
Portable Runtime).  How well will NSPR cooperate with the mono runtime?  If
NSS and NSPR is good enough for Netscape and Sun, don't you think it could
be good enough for us?

Then again, I have no idea what the requirements are for cryptography
support in Mono.  However, I thought I would pass the link along to those
that maybe interested.

Excerpt from www.go-mono.com concering crytography in Mono:
&quot;Also Sebastien Pouliot has been improving the various cryptographic classes
in Mono, something that we had not done in quite some time. We are looking
for a way to handle big-nums. We need either a managed or unmanaged set of
classes for handling large numbers, and some volunteers to expose this
functionality to C# (Either as an internal assembly, or as a set of
P/Invoke, Internal call wrappers&quot;
