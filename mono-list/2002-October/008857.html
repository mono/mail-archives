<PRE>I have heard about mono a few times.. and finaly decided to drop by the 
web site (go-mono.com) ... well .. its nice and all .. however none of 
the web links on the side work.

this is seemingly do to the fact that my web browser is a little more 
picky than some.  And the fact that your page has some incorrect HTML 
in it:

&lt;a class=&quot;navi0&quot;HREF=&quot;contact.html&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/A&gt;

A missing space between the &quot;navi0&quot; and the HREF causes the HREF to 
never get parsed out of the a tag, bummer, thus makeing the entire 
&quot;navi0&quot;HREF=&quot;contact.html&quot;  the actuall value of class.  Which does't 
do much under my browser :P

Well, hope you guys fix this.  It seems to be a 'super' common mistake 
that people are makeing now days. Or it could be that someone is usieng 
one of those HTML editor thngys to do the work for them :(

Either way, hope to see the update and you guys are doing some good 
work. 

See ya

PS, the web browser is Net+  under BeOS :) would try it under something 
else but i don't own any other OS on any of my 5 boxes :P
