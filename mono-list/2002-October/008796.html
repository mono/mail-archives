<PRE>I have a question and I haven't seen it come up previously.  One thing that 
has been stated in the past is that part of the rationale for creating Mono 
was that it would make it easier for the developer and end user as they 
won't have to worry about dependency issues.  How can this be true?  From 
what I have observed, Mono is currently just making calls to various GNOME 
libraries to get most of the work done.  If that is the case, Mono is not 
the platform that it is claimed to be, just another wrapper like Gtk--, 
Gnome--, PyGtk and others.  Would it not me more appropriate to have the end 
goal being to have wrappers for only the GUI portions as to maintain the 
look and feel of GNOME apps?  Eventually all classes in Mono should have 
their own code, should they not?  If they do not, won't the dependency 
problem still exist, only worse?  If I have Mono version X installed and it 
is built against libABC version 1.0 and I have an app that needs libABC 
version 1.5 which breaks compatibility, it will also break Mono which will, 
in turn, break every app that relies on it.  How can this be considered as 
advancement for development on Linux?  This could be a real nightmare.  
Please tell me I am wrong about this!

I am not going to join the list for this, so please include me in any 
replies.

Thanks!
