Hi folks,
up to yesterday I could work with the MonoDevelop-IDE without problems.
Since yesterday I get the following message while launching MonoDevelop
2.2.2 from the KDE-Mainmenu (openSUSE 11.2):

Unhandled Exception. Monodevelop will now close.
Details:
System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Directory 'usr/lib/mono/1.0' not
found.
  at System.IO.Directory.GetFileSystemEntries (System.String path,
System.String searchPattern, FileAttributes mask, FileAttributes attrs)
[0x00000] 
  at System.IO.Directory.GetFiles (System.String path, System.String
searchPattern) [0x00000] 
  at System.IO.Directory.GetFiles (System.String path) [0x00000] 
  at MonoDevelop.Core.Assemblies.DirectoryAssemblyContext.OnUpdatePackages
(System.Object o, System.EventArgs a) [0x00000] 
  at MonoDevelop.Core.Assemblies.TargetRuntime.BackgroundInitialize ()
[0x00000]

This message is displayed after the success-bar within the
Monodevelop-startup-bitmap has reached ~50% of its total length.
What had happened before:
It was very late when I tried to force MonoDevelop to accept the namespaces
System.Drawing and System.Windows.Forms. In order to fix that I added
'usr/lib/mono/1.0' to the configuration of one of my C#-projects. Please
don't ask me why I did this... it was late, I was to fast and I didn't think
in the problems which I would cause by doing so.... 
Since that time I can't launch MonoDevelop anymore. Well, that is not
completely correct... when I log in to the system as a diferent user (root,
testuser...), mono can be launched without any problem. But logged in as the
same user (let's call him &quot;baduser&quot;) who caused the problem, mono doesn't
start. (maybe I simply should apalogize to Monodevelop ?) :-)

In order to find out what's going on, at first I uninstalled the complete
Mono-Software by yast in order to re-install everything once again..... NO
SUCCESS !!!
So I thougt: Anywhere within the system must be an information being kept
(config-file?) which won't be deleted by uninstalling the mono-IDE totaly
and which will be read by mono during it's start-up-procedure. 

So I tried to find out, which files are used by MonoDevelop during it's
start-up-procedure..... I did this by searching for all files which contain
the 'usr/lib/mono/1.0' string and which are newer than the beginning of the
monodevelop-start-up-test. (that means I searched for all files which have
been used during the last ~10 seconds after launching MD). ----The result:
There could no file be found with this properties.

Later I also tried to find out if it is possible to start mono when I'm
logged in as a diferent user. As I wrote above yet, this works fine.
As 'usr/lib/mono/1.0' exits on the system, I also tried to add this path to
some environment-variables.. Once more without success :-(
But at this point I have to admit that I don't know well which
MD-environment-variables would have to be edited in order to solve the
problem.

Now the questions to the experts: 
&gt;<i>From where takes the &quot;brand-new-installed&quot;-MonoDevelop the information about
</I>the &quot;usr/lib/mono/1.0&quot;-Directory and it's relation to the &quot;baduser&quot; ? 
Which environment-variables (beside the standard PATH-Variable of the
Linux-System) do I have to edit in order to inform MonoDevelop about the
&quot;usr/lib/mono/1.0&quot;-directory?
How can I tell MonoDevelop to forget about the stupid path-information
related to the baduser ?

Any help is apreciated... I already spent a lot of time on this problem and
now I don't have further Ideas about a solution... :-(

Thanks a lot in advance.... Rafael
