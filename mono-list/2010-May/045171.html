openSUSE 11.2, MonoDevelop 2.2.2, Mono 2.6.3

I was positioning a form within a .dll and came across a very strange
result.  I needed to get the screen height and width and used
Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Width, Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Height.  The
height worked as expected, giving a value of 1020.  However, the width
produced a value of 7680 when it should have been 1920!

Also, I found that when I resized the form to the screen width and height
(using the right values), I could no longer shrink it back to the original
size.  I'd set this.Width and this.Height to 320 and 240, looking at those
values in the debugger, it showed the proper values, but the form was still
at the max.  I found that if I subtracted 1 from either the max width or
height, it resized properly.  

So, I guess my questions are:

1. What would make the Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Width return such a large
number?
2. Why can't I resize a form once it's been set to the screen width and
height?

---

As I was writing this, I realized that I have 4 desktops... 4 x 1920 = 7680! 
So, I assume that Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Width is the width of all four
desktops.  Is that correct?
