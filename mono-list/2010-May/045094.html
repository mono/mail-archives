OMG... I had tried IPEndPoint localEndPoint = new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any,
6267); without success (along with many other options) and it had failed. 
When Alan asked me about the firewall, I disabled it and forgot to start it
back up.  I just tried it again with IPAddress.Any and it worked!!   Works
with 192.168.1.66 too!

So I am seeing the packets come in BEFORE the firewall kills them.  That was
the problem all along.  Since I was seeing the packets, I thought they were
coming through and was not smart enough to turn off the stupid firewall.  

Thanks so much to everyone your help and your patience... I am not worthy! 
;-)
