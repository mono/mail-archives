The bad news first: the Windows build is broken at present.
Comments inline.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the error message:

This probably a problem on your side. Do you have an official
Mono installation in your path as suggested by Shana's docs?

&gt;<i> I'm following the instructions on this excellent (but, I think, slightly
</I>&gt;<i> out of date) blog post:
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://shana.worldofcoding.com/en/mono_cygwin_tutorial.html">http://shana.worldofcoding.com/en/mono_cygwin_tutorial.html</A>&gt;, which is
</I>&gt;<i> linked from the Mono website.
</I>
They are still relevant (modulo version numbers).

&gt;<i> * I created a fresh Cygwin install, with the packages described, with
</I>&gt;<i> the path set up appropriately for the new packaged Mono install location.
</I>
See above.

&gt;<i> * I installed make 3.80 from the Mono website -- it needed libintl2 in
</I>&gt;<i> addition to the other Cygwin packages mentioned in the blog post.  (Now
</I>&gt;<i> that Cygwin has 3.81 in its package repo, I imagine that this might no
</I>&gt;<i> longer be necessary, but I felt it was worth sticking with what was
</I>&gt;<i> meant to work...)
</I>
This special Make version is still required.

&gt;<i> * I ran ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local in /usr/src/mono/ -- it
</I>&gt;<i> initially gave a bunch of errors, apparently due to DOS line endings in
</I>&gt;<i> eglib/autogen.sh.  However, I wasn't sure if these were expected...
</I>
The CRLF issue is probably caused by a Tortoise SVN checkout.
You're supposed to use cygwin's svn and also take care to mount
cygwin's &quot;drives&quot; in binary mode (it's the default, though).

&gt;<i> * ...so I ran make, and got &quot;mv: cannot stat `t-es.gmo': No such file or
</I>&gt;<i> directory&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> * Google pointed me here
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2008-September/039671.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/mono-list/2008-September/039671.html</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> so I installed gettext-devel as advised.
</I>
Another solution is to autogen with --enable-nls=no or --disable-nls.

&gt;<i> * I got the error reported at the start of this email, and spend some
</I>&gt;<i> time trying to work out what was happening vs what was meant to be
</I>&gt;<i> happening, and got nowhere.
</I>
You're not alone on the journey to nowhere :) I'll post a
status update if I manage to fix the build.
