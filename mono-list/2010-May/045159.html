My apologies, I meant that changing the permissions (making the device
world-readable and world-writable) was quick-and-dirty.  Adding users to
groups that have access to devices is the proper way to grant
permissions to access such devices.  When possible, your users should
take this route.

If you really want to you can write a shell script that tests if the
user has read and write access to the serial port.  If they do, it just
runs your program.  Otherwise, it runs gksu or su to invoke your Mono
app as root.

This is probably the cleanest mechanism if you don't want to require
that your users properly assign groups to users, since it separates the
authentication and authorization steps from your app entirely.
