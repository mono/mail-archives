I would love to think that the configuration documentation I've read and the
various posts are poorly written.  Probably not.   It is more likely that I
am in vapors over a project deadline and have been working too many hours.

My question, I think is very basic.  On Windows System 7,  I've installed
Mono-2.6.4   It resides in the folder: c:\program files (x86)\Mono-2.6.4

In folder:  c:\program files(x86)\semr-3.1  I have an installations of php,
apache and mysql
The docroot is set to ~apache2\htdocs

Within htdocs  I have an application  bioplugin.asmx  There is also a folder
\bin which contains a dll needed by the bioplugin.asmx   presumably this
relative path is all that is required. 

My  httpd.conf reads (mono stuff only)

LoadModule mono_module modules/mod_mono.so   
AddHandler mono .aspx .ascx .asax .ashx .config .cs .asmx .axd
MonoApplications  default &quot;foo&quot;

It is that last line that is tripping me up.  I've seen 2 different
implementations and nothing I've tried has worked.

Its entirely possible that there is more to this, but I don't know..   I'm
not a Windows person and would love to see foo replaced with something that
would work for 32 bit and 64 bit installs and on installations on computers
not running in English.  But I will be happy with anything I can get that
works.

Would greatly appreciate any help.

Rogers
