</I>&gt;<i> Hello Gert,
</I>
Hello Miguel,

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Will you be removing all 1.0 specific code (paths)?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Will support for building the net_1_1 profile be removed altogether (or
</I>will
&gt;<i> &gt; you just need to opt-in)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I would like to do that: remove all the ifdefs for net_1_1 on post
</I>&gt;<i> Mono 2.6 releases, and remove all the tests for 1.1 compatibility as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>
Personally, I think we'll waste more cycles on this than that it will bring
benefit.
I'm sure there are more urgent matters.
I know the ifdefs are a mess, but we'll have them anyway (if we do not only
want compatibility with MS's latest and greatest).

&gt;<i> &gt; Will you discourage packagers to include the net_1_1 profile?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand that Novell itself cannot continue supporting all profiles,
</I>but
&gt;<i> &gt; I think you should at least allow the community to continue this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My feeling is that we should come to a place where you can have two Mono
</I>&gt;<i> runtimes installed, an older one to run the 1.0 runtime, and another one
</I>&gt;<i> to run 2.0 and 4.0.
</I>
Are you planning on creating a branch that can still be actively worked on
by/for those that want to maintain the highest level of compatibility with
.NET 1.1?

I'm not sure if anyone is even interested in this. If there is, then I
assume they will even want to create new (bugfix/security fix) releases.

&gt;<i> The issue is not only a problem with build times taking longer for each
</I>&gt;<i> developer, they also take longer one each build bot, it almost doubles
</I>&gt;<i> the test suite run times, and it wastes developer time (Novell or
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise) making sure that we do not break the 1.0 profile.
</I>
Sure, but you could just make the 1.0 profile opt-in.
And perhaps only run the build bot test for that profile once a week (and
leave it up to contributors to deal with it).

&gt;<i> With the introduction of the 4.0 APIs with a new mscorlib we will end up
</I>&gt;<i> in a situation where every check in has to be tested and compiled
</I>&gt;<i> against 3 versions.   It is an amount of work that is slowing Mono down
</I>&gt;<i> as a whole.
</I>
I understand, and making the 1.0 profile opt-in would deal with that.
You should also make it clear that the 1.0 profile is no longer endorsed by
Novell.

&gt;<i> I rather invest in finding creative ways of packaging and installing two
</I>&gt;<i> monos in parallel for those that want to have 1.0 based apps.
</I>
Is this something that you will do or want to do ? ;-)

Note that I'm not opposed to making the 1.0 profile a second-class citizen,
but I consider removing it altogether a radical change.

Gert
