Unfortunately there is no C# DOM wrapper for either Gecko# or WebKit.
AFAIK there is one there is for Mono's WinForms web control
(gluezilla), so it could perhaps be adapted for Gecko#. It might even
be possible to use gluezilla as the basis of a GTK# control, skipping
gtkmozembed entirely.

Back in 2005, before Webkit-GTK or mozembed existed, AspNetEdit (an
ASP.NET editor) did Gecko# C#&lt;-&gt;JS interop this very effectively using
a horrible hack - message-passing between C# and JS, using the status
bar and the URL string. As far as I know, this still works. You can
find the code in Mono SVN:
<A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/jscall-sharp/">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/jscall-sharp/</A>
I recommend copying the C# files into your app instead of building as
a separate library.

&gt;<i> Also, how well would this work on Windows at this time
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. gecko-sharp, and xul, and libgtkembedmoz and such)?
</I>
Gecko# worked pretty well on Windows last time I tried - but that was
2005. I don't think there have been any newer builds since then, but
if you could find the old installers, they'd probably still work.

I know this is a weak point in the cross-platform GTK# story, but
getting a cross-platform web browser control that can integrate with
GTK is quite difficult. Mozilla/Gecko doesn't make embedding easy at
the best of times, and is only designed to use GTK on Unix/Linux.
Going forwards, Webkit-GTK is probably better.
