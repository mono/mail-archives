<PRE>Hi,
I was looking at the tutorials available for GTK#, and none of them seem to
be as good as the tutorials available for PyGtk or Gtk+. I realized that the
PyGtk tutorial is almost like a port of the original GTK+ tutorial with some
added tutorials regarding TreeViews, etc.

Since GTK# bears some significant similarity over PyGTK, I felt that it
wouldn't be too challenging to port the code samples and syntax from the
original tutorial to a newer one. The structure of the tutorial and the
content has been tested for several years and seem to be effective enough as
a starting point for material. I decided to start an ambitious attempt to
port the entire tutorial to GTK# within the next few weeks)

The original PyGtk tutorial can be accessed from here:
<A HREF="http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/">http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/</A>

I have attempted porting a single section just to get a feel for it. You can
see the original &quot;Buttons&quot; tutorial here -
<A HREF="http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/ch-ButtonWidget.html">http://pygtk.org/pygtk2tutorial/ch-ButtonWidget.html</A>
And also compare it with my attempt available here:
<A HREF="http://www.ninjagod.com/gtk-sharp/wikka.php?wakka=Buttons">http://www.ninjagod.com/gtk-sharp/wikka.php?wakka=Buttons</A>

The conversion was relatively effortless and required a single concise
read-through and porting the code line-by-line. The rest was just
copy-paste. Porting is a lot easier if you have an understanding of Python
(I did), but it's quite readable and obvious. I guess we also need to write
whole programs and make the source available after testing and making sure
that it works (My code that I put up there doesn't). It took about half an
hour to get it done.

I'm hoping that with enough contributors sharing the work, and not altering
content significantly, we can finish the conversion fast and effectively,
and make the learning content available for people who are new to GTK#
development, and leverage existing documentation. Please email me if you are
interested in contributing.

Also, for people who have done something like this before, any advice
regarding the tools to use, etc would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Andy
