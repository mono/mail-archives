Yes, as a matter of fact there is. Both the class that is has the event 
(and is calling the event) and the class that is subscribing are based 
on generics. I have a base generic class that takes one type parameter:

abstract public class BasicClass&lt;TKey&gt; { ... }

And then both the class that has and calls the event, plus the class 
that subscribes to the event inherit from this class:

public class EventsCallers : BasicClass&lt;string&gt; { ... }
public class Subscribers : BasicClass&lt;object&gt; { ... }

</I>
Tried it with rev 123349 (on Linux) and 2.4.2 (on Windows), both did not 
work with my code.

&gt;<i> Could you please test whether your app works with r122085 (or earlier)?
</I>
During my search for what revision broke things I found:

Rev 126000 -&gt; Did NOT work.
Rev 125000 -&gt; Did NOT work.
Rev 124000 -&gt; Did NOT work.
Rev 123000 -&gt; Worked
Rev 122000 -&gt; Mono failed to compile, skipped.
Rev 121000 -&gt; Did NOT work.
Rev 120000 -&gt; Did NOT work.

I took the first revision where it worked and starting moving forward 
until I found 123349 (first by 100 revision steps, then by 10, then by 
1). I did not investigate why it broke again in the earlier revs.

Thanks.

PS. The 'git bisect' command indeed looks cool! Looks like I better find 
time to learn about git. :)
