<PRE>
We're working on a project to convert MS Access applications to ASP.net using
a product called Microtools.  It's clunky and we end up doing a lot of
debugging but we've been able to get Northwind to run locally after
conversion to ASP.net.  Problem comes in when we copy the website to the
server (Suse) which has Mono and the latest Mysql connector on it.  After
copying it over there are errors pertaining to the odbc connection when you
pull up the screens on Mono.  What's apparent to me is that the DSN in
windows and the web.config file are set to a windows version of the mysql
driver (5.1).  When you move it over all of a sudden linux is unable to
match that DSN name so it defaults to the system odbc driver libodbc.so.  We
went through the process of installing unixODBC but it's now saying there is
no default data source set up.  Which means to me that it's still not using
the mysql connector.  

Would we be doing any better to put monodevelop on the linux box and debug
the c# asp code that we get from microtools there?  Would monodevelop do a
better job of getting the db connection to mysql?  What we're up against
right now is that the changes we're making in visual studio to the
web.config to make it work on the windows desktop don't have an equivalent
in linux and for the life of me I can't make the web.config use the mysql
connector.

Would monodevelop have a better chance of reading the mysql connection if we
developed on the linux box instead of the windows box?  We still have to run
microtools and access in windows but maybe we could just push the converted
code out to the server and debug it there so that when it's running
correctly in testing we'll know there is not an extra step to make it talk
to mysql on the linux box.
