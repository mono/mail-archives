Hello all. I've some strange behavior on Red Hat that's not cropping up on
windows or OSX. Here's what I've got: an extremely simple Windows Forms app
wherein I've added the following to the form's constructor:

this.WindowState = WindowState.Maximized;

That's it. I ad nothing else. I compile and run. When I run under mono on my
Windows box it works fine. I then try it on red Hat and Mono 1.9. It works
fine there as well (i.e. the form is maximized upon startup).

The problem is with my actual application (not the aforementioned test)
where the above has no effect. My application is supposed to maximize the
window and then, based on the client dimensions, do a bunch of drawing. I've
added the following to the form's constructor:

this.WindowState = WindowState.Maximized;
this.Update();

This has no effect i.e. the form is the default small size when run under
Mono and Red Hat. I've tried with and without &quot;Update()&quot; called and it makes
no difference, the form will not maximize upon startup. Out of desperation I
tried changing the form's property in the property window to &quot;Maximized&quot;
(I'm using VS2008) and then recompile/run. No go. The form is still small
and centered. As I mentioned, this DOES work on the same computer in the
tiny test app at the beginning of my post. Why would the form maximize
properly in one case but not in the other...on the same computer? I do not
explicitely size the form at any time other than at the beginning when I set
the WindowState property to Maximized. I have no idea where to start looking
for the problem on this one. Does anyone have any ideas at all? Can't
imagine what it could be... :-(
