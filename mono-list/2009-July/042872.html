For next time, you might want to just import the offending repository to
git and run &quot;git bisect&quot; on it. It would have saved you quite a bit of

I think it's about time I start offering mono as a git repository.
Especially since git support is being added to Mono as a gsoc project.
Does anyone know how that's coming along, btw?

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
