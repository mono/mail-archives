<PRE>Tonight we publish the second (or third if you were watching closely)
public preview of Mono 2.8[0].  To see what's been fixed since the first
preview head over to github[6] and read the commits on mono-2-8 from
d88e223dd4bd0469594e to 58f029f2d1a2ed2c3f16 (older to newer).

We are still fixing a problem hitting breakpoints when remotely
debugging using Mono Tools for Visual Studio but as far as we know
that's the only bug holding back the final release of 2.8.

If you find a bug please report it: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Bugs">http://www.mono-project.com/Bugs</A>
Also, the QA team asks that we put the string &quot;mono-2.8&quot; (without
quotes) in the whiteboard field on the bug report.
Internally this is Preview 6, so mention that in your bugs.

If you use mono on windows we strongly encourage you to do some testing
now as we have not done a lot of testing on windows ourselves.
Community power activate!

There have been some further changes to the RPM spec file so packagers
are again encouraged to peruse the spec on github[4].

</I>&gt;<i> Packagers for distributions like Fedora are strongly encouraged to have a look at the mono-core.spec file[4] as there are a large number of new assemblies and we have rearranged a few packages to break cyclical dependencies etc..

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Mono Project is very much alive and a lot of work has gone into this release.  We are positioning 2.8 as a sort of early version of what will eventually become Mono 3.0.  The next release after 2.8 will be 2.8.2 which will be branched from Git master.  This means that we will not be maintaining the mono-2-8 branch (except possibly for security fixes).  We will continue in this fashion until 3.0 to allow developers to stay focused on their work and not maintain multiple branches.
