Does ProjectB use *any* extension methods?  If so, do they work?

If not, check if ProjectB references System.Core.  If it does not then
this may be the cause of your compilation errors, since the attribute
that designates a method as an extension method is declared in
System.Core.  (The &quot;this&quot; syntax for declaring extension methods is
actually just syntactic sugar for the application of this attribute.)

If you can compile under VS without referencing System.Core then this
could be considered a Mono bug.

And, as a final note, if this doesn't work, or if you are already
referencing System.Core, then try to create a solution that reproduces
the problem with minimal code.  It's a bit hard to assist without having
something we can tinker with and try to fix.
