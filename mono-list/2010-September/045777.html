There are two approaches that come to mind:

* The Banshee approach.  There is a library written in C that provides
the glue between Banshee and GStreamer, an open-source library that can
(among a wealth of other things) play sound files.  The glue library is
the only one that you should P/Invoke, and it will need to be compiled
for each platform.  (Windows support for GStreamer can be tricky.)

* The MPlayer approach.  I do not know much about this personally,
having spent much more time hacking on the Banshee library.  But I've
heard from others that you can embed an MPlayer instance within your
application with relatively little effort.  I don't recall whether this
is a cross-platform solution or not.
