It is not really possible, because the warning flag applies to the
entire assembly.  I say that we should rather aim towards removing all
warnings on the long run, but we can add the /nowarn switches for these
in the meantime if it is going to help us robustify the code we have.

I bet robustify is not a word.

</I>
How do you run NUnit in console mode?  Can you post some few
instructions?  I would love to help fix some of the errors if I knew how
to do it ;-)

&gt;<i> Agreed.  I would suggest we add something to the web site that explains
</I>&gt;<i> that.  In the meantime, perhaps we should notify the class maintainer of any
</I>&gt;<i> class that currently does not pass unit tests, and see if they can provide a
</I>&gt;<i> fix.  If they can not, for whatever reason, or do not respond within a
</I>&gt;<i> couple of days then we request that someone else take on the task. Also, as
</I>&gt;<i> Joel S. suggests, we should not be adding any new classes or functionality
</I>&gt;<i> until all the tests pass. These are, by definition, &quot;known bugs.&quot;
</I>
I agree in principle, but given the nature of the project (its
distributedness, its compartimentalization, the stuff that we maintain
and develop independently of the contributions) it is hard to do (I bet
more words in the above paragraph dont exit)

&gt;<i> I did indeed commit those.  Over the weekend I added parameter checking to
</I>&gt;<i> the StringBuilder constructors and throw appropriate exceptions now, just
</I>&gt;<i> like the MS class.  However, I didn't get to check that in yet.  I will do
</I>&gt;<i> so when I get home tonight. I was distracted when my 3 year old put a bunch
</I>&gt;<i> of melted chocolate all over my keyboard :).
</I>
Oh so sweet!  Do you have pictures? ;-)
