<PRE>[ Sean: I think it would be good to post a summary of the errors in
  the class library, or keep it on the Web site so people can see it 
]

&gt;<i> Hi, I am interested in helping contribute to Mono in anyway I
</I>&gt;<i> can. Preferrably coding. Judging by the website, development is
</I>&gt;<i> being done promarily on the windows side, so what needs to be done,
</I>&gt;<i> or who needs help, etc? :)
</I>
There are many areas that need work, which area you want to contribute
depends on:

	* Your current experience.

	* Your interest in learning to do something new (many hackers
          like to learn something new, and this is a way of learning a
          new technology, or understand in deep an existing piece of
          it).

	* Your desires: do you want to work on completeness,
          optimization, deployability?

That being said, there are a few areas of interest:

	* Class Libraries (Sean has ran the test suite and find many
	  things that need to be corrected).

	* Writing more tests for our core class libraries.  This
          ensures that we have a solid foundation to build upon.

	* New classes.  Things that have not been implemented.

	* C# Compiler.  There are various areas where you could help
          in the compiler.

		* Catching more errors.
		* Implementing missing features.
		* Taking on a whole &quot;subsystem&quot;.
		* Enhancing our regression test suite.

	* Runtime.

		* Integrate Dick's extracted GC system into the build
		  process.	

		* Integrate the GC system into the JITer and the
                  interpreter.

		* Make sure that our P/Invoke support is complete and
                  not just &quot;good enough&quot; for now.

	* System.Reflection.Emit

		* Help Paolo out with the System.Reflection and
                  System.Reflection.Emit implementations.


Miguel.
