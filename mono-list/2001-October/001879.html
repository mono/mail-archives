&gt;<i> From my arm chair I understand it to be used as a medium

That is definately one very important aspect of the framework. You were 
right.  There are other important parts such as the new VM system, bringing 
garbage collection and threading to all of these languages.  It basically has 
all the strengths of the Java VM with a good dose of new innovations such as 
the common language runtime.  There is every reason to believe that it will 
be faster than the Java VM's also.  With projects like Mono I think it is 
possible .NET could even grow into an embedded platform.  Despite what MS 
says .NET the SDK _IS_ a reaction to Java, but IMHO that is not such a bad 
thing as long as projects like mono continue.
