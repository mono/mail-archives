Thanks for the detailed response.  I hope Mono
is successful and even that I can contribute.
My secret hope is that:

1. 3rd party MS-Windows app developers will
want to avoid any APIs that won't work across
Win/.NET &amp; Linux/Mono. Why wouldn't they desire to be
able to run/sell their wares on another platform (Linux)???
(Oops, on the other hand they won't be Open
Source so maybe not so useful.)

2. 3rd party MS-Windows app developers will
say, &quot;Hey, programming for GNOME is just
like Windows!&quot; and consider GNOME in droves.

Thanks again,

Chris

</I>&gt;<i> System.Windows.Forms.IWin32Window - Uggh!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I, also, believe that the closer the platform is to the standard the better.
</I>&gt;<i> Where it diverges is somewhere in between but hopefully the software developer
</I>&gt;<i> will never know.  Call it the curse of the Java Phuel. Also, the MS version is
</I>&gt;<i> constantly changing and I would expect to see differences between now and any
</I>&gt;<i> December/January release.  That said there are some nice design aspects to .Net.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The System.Drawing is pretty much a thin wrapper over Win32 so there is a large
</I>&gt;<i> base of users who understand the API.  Although, this isn't evidence of a
</I>&gt;<i> superior design it pretty much means that a lot of developers have successfully
</I>&gt;<i> written applications that work. At any rate MS won't change the design to any
</I>&gt;<i> significant degree in years to come.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The .Net, GDK, and Java libraries are very close in many ways already.  There
</I>&gt;<i> are tons of new little bitty features in the members of many of the classes.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think its easier to do Alpha Blending and Transparency effects.  You can pass a
</I>&gt;<i> memory bitmap as a stream to a socket or file.  Makes serializing graphics from
</I>&gt;<i> a web server very efficient without ever having to touch the hard disk.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Specifying Anchoring, Window Docking, and Windowing Styles (SDI/MDI/etc) are
</I>&gt;<i> nicely designed. They are easy to use/specify.  Placing and organization windows
</I>&gt;<i> within frames is again easy to do.  They are organized into collections and are
</I>&gt;<i> easy to manipulate from your language's array syntax.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You get a few more kind of controls that are different, like PropertyGrid, than
</I>&gt;<i> you do in GTK+/Bonobo. Compare GtkList and ListView. However, there are largely
</I>&gt;<i> the same constructs in either library.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The .Net library is more like the Java library when compared to traditional
</I>&gt;<i> Windows programming.  MS looks to have put in a lot of work to make it more
</I>&gt;<i> generic.  Why not do this for the Mono version of .Net?  The event model for the
</I>&gt;<i> .Net controls is more like signals and less like traditional WM_ messages.  Very
</I>&gt;<i> simplistic and easy to adapt/adopt plus the coordination between the WinForms
</I>&gt;<i> and the WebForms has been thought out in the .Net design.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are many parallels that went into the design of the WinForms and WebForms.
</I>&gt;<i> You have to respect the effort and consideration that went into the design of
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchies that are so dissimilar.  When comparing WebForms with Tomcat, I find
</I>&gt;<i> WebForms to have the better design.  WebForms is newer since Tomcat came out
</I>&gt;<i> earlier. WebForms seems to have looked at that design and improved on the ideas
</I>&gt;<i> behind it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In short, I really don't think a comparison between WinForms and GTK+/Bonobo is
</I>&gt;<i> really a good idea.  We are in the era of large frameworks and the features
</I>&gt;<i> don't match always match up with features at such a granular level.  It is much
</I>&gt;<i> more appropriate to compare .Net against J2EE or Mono/Linux as whole.  What in
</I>&gt;<i> GTK+/Bonobo compares to these:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The applications that I've written so far have required very little code to get
</I>&gt;<i> functionality into an application.  That's a lot of bang for a little buck so I
</I>&gt;<i> won't end up with carpel-tunnel-syndrome at the end of the day.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the .Net resource/globalization design is nicer. More helpful when your
</I>&gt;<i> packaging sounds and graphics with applications.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DataBinding (SQL, XML) classes are nicely designed and make it very easy to hook
</I>&gt;<i> up a database query or cursor up to a WinForm and WebForm control.  Works great
</I>&gt;<i> moving data between table oriented SQL data and tag oriented XML data.  Very
</I>&gt;<i> little work on my part.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The manner in which you can introduce high availability (Load Balancing,
</I>&gt;<i> Transactioning, etc..) features into a code base or &quot;form&quot; (through attribute
</I>&gt;<i> usage) doesn't compare to anything in GTK+/Bonobo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The WinForms and WebForms Designers are an incredible advantage over
</I>&gt;<i> GTK+/Bonobo. They pretty much guarantees that your less sophisticated developers
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to write software for either deployment model (Win/Web).  The VB
</I>&gt;<i> generation of software design is really the first successful attempt at
</I>&gt;<i> graphical software design.  Think of how you would use a UML product to do
</I>&gt;<i> graphical software design? The VB pallet is what that is; however, your
</I>&gt;<i> substituting ComboBoxes, Edit Controls, and Labels for Class Diagrams, Use
</I>&gt;<i> Cases, and Messages.  Something to think about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> GTK+/Bonobo doesn't do a lot to provide language interop. Unless interop between
</I>&gt;<i> C and C++ is nirvana in the programming world. There is always CORBA but that
</I>&gt;<i> would have you nibbling on the barrel pretty shortly. :-(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The framework is where competition is taking place.  It is not in the Windowing
</I>&gt;<i> (WinForms) arena.  That battle has been fought and everybody pretty much looks
</I>&gt;<i> the same anyway.  New framework competition is in the WebForms arena.  Many of
</I>&gt;<i> the tool developers, I know pretty much have the same opinion.  The big
</I>&gt;<i> companies are beginning to provide the technology that delivers the web in an
</I>&gt;<i> easier fashion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We've seen the bottom fall out of the .COM (The Web not [D]COM/CORBA) market and
</I>&gt;<i> much of the historical value is quickly eroding.  From my perspective, there is
</I>&gt;<i> a real squeeze going on in the market since fewer and fewer companies are
</I>&gt;<i> providing more and more of the framework.  In the past having 5% of the tool
</I>&gt;<i> market was a pretty big share, not anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I been stuck off doing other stuff and this turned into more of a rant so I have
</I>&gt;<i> to apologize.  In one aspect .Net is a 'standard' implementation.   Having an
</I>&gt;<i> implementation that matches the standard isn't a bad idea. I think a crew of
</I>&gt;<i> developers is introducing System.GTKPlusBonobo library somewhere. Each platform
</I>&gt;<i> has its own problems and if that isn't apparent then your not using enough
</I>&gt;<i> computers.
