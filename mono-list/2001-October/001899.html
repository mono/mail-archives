<PRE>Hey Rafael,

	Well, looks like Miguel has gone to sleep already :-) Okay, I have the
stuff with me. I shall apply them in my tree and commit when I have
Miguel's approval. I also have some other things that I need to commit
anyway.


	Miguel, lemme know when you are up. I will merge these in on your word
unless you want to do it yourself in which case, just tell me that too
;-)



	Regards,

		Ravi
