I think that the Liberty Alliance people are in what appears to be on
the right track.

Microsoft announced last week that they would move Passport to Kerberos
and that they would fold back all the changes to Kerberos, part of their
announcements also included things like a federated Kerberos system
where third parties could plug into the federated namespace.

It makes a lot of sense.  Now it is only a matter of watching who
delivers first the best implementation that can be adopted by the
industry taking into account the various issues (privacy, risks,
reliability, points of failure, etc).

Miguel.
