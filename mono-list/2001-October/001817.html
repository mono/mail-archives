Hi

&gt;<i> What kind of limitations are you running into Windows.Forms, I want to
</I>&gt;<i> know what kind of deficiencies it has.
</I>
- Controls have a size limit of 32768 pixels (SharpDevelop can &quot;only&quot; =
view
   files with 2200 lines ... I don't want a 16bit int limit 2001)
- Building a forms designer is quite difficult ... MS hides much
functionalaty
- Docking Windows/Tab Controls are really no fun to implement, to get
something
   VS.NET like you have to build it from ground up and use dllimport. =
I'm
not sure
   that it can be done without the &quot;old&quot; windows apis
- There are only few controls that can be used with windows.forms
- The Windows.Forms do have a &quot;bad&quot; design.
    - You don't get events for every case (ex. you get no event when you
move a window ...
       VS.NET style docking is only possible with this in my opinion. =
The
don't use Drag&amp;Drop
       they use windows moving)
    - It sux that Microsoft uses neat controls for their stuff which =
can't
be used for own programs
        - The helpsystem
        - Menu Items with Icons (you have to build your own)
        - Tab Controls
        - Docking ...
    - Startup performance is horrible when you use Windows.Forms
    -  I'm not a big java fan, but the Swing classes do have an overall
better design than the
       Windows.Forms.

I  don't know if I will use a GTK+/GNOME wrapper, because I don't know =
the
GTK+/GNOME
limits, but I'm pretty sure that this library don't &quot;hide&quot; all important
information.
I think that I just &quot;try&quot; GTK+/GNOME, maybe it will suite my needs much
better than Windows.Forms.
My &quot;plan&quot; it is to write a little GUI designer for this library and if I
suceed I could transform
sharpdevelop to the other library. (Windows.Forms causes too many =
headaches
... I hope really
that GTK+ is better, but I don't have GTK+ experience ... under linux I =
was
too lazy to learn a
GUI api ... there are way to many ... gtk, qt, wxwindows, motif (old but
still used) ...)

Maybe it would be better to build a GUI library from ground up in C#, =
but if
the GTK+/GNOME
wrapper is good and don't have too many design flaws it should be ok to =
use.

cya
