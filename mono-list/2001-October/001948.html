Some changes have been added to the FAQ, but it has always stated very
clearly what Mono is.  It was one of the main talking points during its
announcement.

Some people have decided to ignore the facts to push their own agendas,
some of them reporters and it is hard to do anything about it.

The passport.html file was posted to this list, or at least a pointer to
it to clarify the issue of passport a long time ago. 

The particular notes that explain what Mono is, and the fact that is not
related to passport were added (according to CVS):

File: mono/doc/faq,v Version: 1.2
date: 2001/07/03 23:51:05;  author: miguel;  state: Exp;  lines: +42 -1

Which is before Mono was even announced to the public.  So yes, it has
been there ;-)

Anyways, I have to head back to work on the compiler ;-)

Miguel.
