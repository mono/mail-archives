&gt;<i> From my arm chair I understand it to be used as a medium
</I>&gt;<i> for accessing libraries, services and objects in a language independent
</I>&gt;<i> manner. Don't hold me to that I'm probably wrong.

That is definately one very important aspect of the framework. You were
right.  There are other important parts such as the new VM system, bringing
garbage collection and threading to all of these languages.  It basically has
all the strengths of the Java VM with a good dose of new innovations such as
the common language runtime.  There is every reason to believe that it will
be faster than the Java VM's also.  With projects like Mono I think it is
possible .NET could even grow into an embedded platform.  Despite what MS
says .NET the SDK _IS_ a reaction to Java, but IMHO that is not such a bad
thing as long as projects like mono continue.
