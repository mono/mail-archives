Excellent!   Thanks a lot for the contribution Derek!

</I>
What about:

	for (int n = -10000; n &lt; 10000; n++)
		Assert ( [microsoft's] n.ToString(format) == [mono's] n.ToString(format) )

Could you post your test, or check it into CVS?

With the compiler I have learned to appreciate more and more having a
regression test suite.  Right now Ravi and I have a rule of `Do not
check in changes to the compiler in CVS if the test suite fails' which
is really helpful, because it is easy to break something
inadvertently.

It is easier to find a bug when you have fresh in your mind the
changes that you have done and can better infer the source of the
problem on far reaching so this has been very helpful for us.

&gt;<i> It also seems to be using the NumberFormatInfo stuff properly, but that'd be
</I>&gt;<i> even harder to write a test for. There's a lot you can do with the
</I>&gt;<i> NumberFormatInfo patterns and symbols to get custom printings of currency
</I>&gt;<i> and percents and stuff, but you have to set up a FormatProvider and lay out
</I>&gt;<i> patterns. If anyone is interested in NUnit'ing that I can send some tests I
</I>&gt;<i> did with it.
</I>
Wow, you have done a great job!  i love the IntegerFormatter, thanks a
lot man!

Miguel.
