.NET My Services has two sides of it:

	* The Service Providers  and their backing storage (Passport
authentication, Alarms, Calendars, etc).

	* A very simple API to access those

Ximian is not in the business of becoming a backing storage provider, or
be part of the announced federated authenatication system.  Other people
will (Microsoft, maybe some banks, maybe ISPs, maybe authentication
authorities, countries, god knows what else).

The APIs are pretty trivial operations on a database &quot;add record&quot;,
&quot;update record&quot;, &quot;delete record&quot; kind of thing.  There are no .NET
classes yet to access them, and I dont think doing some at this points
makes any sense.

So the short answer is: no ;-)

Miguel
