<PRE>Dear Lloyd:

I apologize for the harsh language, it was totally unnecessary, definitely
not to the level of the kind of people that read this posts.

I apologize if I sound like a troll. As you might imagine I receive a couple
a well deserved hate replies &lt;gasp&gt;.

The truth is that I am honestly concerned about Microsoft giving you guy's
hell and destroying Mono. If anyone could provide some links to educate my
self I will appreciate it very much.

Keep up the good work and sorry for the inconvenience this will be my last
off-topic post here.

Please accept my apologies. Thanks for reading.

Sorry for this out of topics post,
But I have not laugh so much for a long time.

Hum, MS is so inherently evil ?! Impressive !
I especially like the way you wrote and the emotion you feed us....

Anyway you know, you are nt prisoner of MS, it is other company who
doesn't bring you freedom...
Mono, here, just bring it to you...

And, btw, it is better to learn from your enemy !
The better you know him, the weaker it will be !
