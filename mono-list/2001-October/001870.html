<PRE>Greetings,

This is just an FYI to let you know that a tool is now publicly available
that takes the XML-based standard CLI Class Library Definition and, through
XSL transformation, creates standards-compliant C# stub code for the entire
standard. Included in this stub code are the class and member signatures,
documentation for the class and members, default return values for members
and exceptions thrown by each member.

This tool is very useful for CLI library developers to give them a huge head
start on their development. Manually coding what the tool produces
definitely takes a lot of time and can also be error prone. Also, if
standards compliance is part of your end goal, the tool definitely helps
provide a big step in that direction.

Also, the tool can generate Microsoft* Word document files that provide the
complete documentation for every type in the standard.

The tool is located at: <A HREF="http://www.intel.com/ids/dotnet">http://www.intel.com/ids/dotnet</A> under the What's New
Section (XML Transformation Tool). It is freely available under the Intel
Open Source License (a BSD license with export notice...very liberal). You
have to register for IDS to gain access to the tool, but registration is
fast and easy. The actual link to the tool is within the PDF document that
describes the tool.

The latest version of the XML-based CLI Library definition is currently
located at: <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/net/ecma.">http://www.microsoft.com/net/ecma.</A>
