<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Would 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it be a good idea to include a switch to the compiler for &quot;in flux&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sources to suppress those warnings?  Namely the CS0649 and CS0169 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; warnings?  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is not really possible, because the warning flag applies 
</I>&gt;<i> to the entire assembly.  I say that we should rather aim 
</I>&gt;<i> towards removing all warnings on the long run, but we can add 
</I>&gt;<i> the /nowarn switches for these in the meantime if it is going 
</I>&gt;<i> to help us robustify the code we have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I bet robustify is not a word.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Too bad about that limitation.  However, my vote is to put in the
/nowarn's anyway for these two. Right now they are just telling us that
the class is not done, which the author already knows.  To others it's
just confusing noise.

And, yes...I think the word you are looking for is &quot;Robustification&quot; ;)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How do you run NUnit in console mode?  Can you post some few 
</I>&gt;<i> instructions?  I would love to help fix some of the errors if 
</I>&gt;<i> I knew how to do it ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
From the mcs directory just do this:
nunit/NUnitConsole.exe
MonoTests.AllTests,class/corlib/Test/corlib_test.dll

On my box I get 23 Failures and 16 Errors.  Not a pretty sight.

The problems are clustered around just a few classes it looks like, so
maybe the problem is not very broad-based.  I'll be you can fix 'em all
in just a few minutes :)
