<PRE>Sir,

I am Nishant Gupta purisuing engineering from Netaji Subhas Institute Of
Technology, Dwarka, New Delhi is keen on doing the project under you.
I have been doing programs in C/C++ since my school days and have the
experience of 5-6 years. I had won 1st prize in my inter college event
that was related to c++ quiz, won 2nd prize in linux challenge which was
coding c programs in linux.

When it comes programming in c++ I know about pointers, arrays,
structure, working with functions classes, constructor/ destruct or,
hierarchies, file handling.




Sir when I saw your project and studied about it I know that I could do
this project and its a good opportunity for me to implement my knowledge
on a good scale so that I could explore my capabilities by working on
such kind project.

I request you to consider me for this project and guide me how should I
work onto it because I know could do it but needs a proper guidance on it.

Thanking you

Nishant Gupta
