.NET 1.1 does not support custom XML serializers, i.e.
by providing a new XmlSerializer implementation, but
the XML serialization can be controlled up to some level.
(I guess you already know this).

I meant &quot;complex for XML serialization&quot;, which in many cases means
&quot;basic&quot; for domain models.

</I>
You could annotate the domain model with some custom attributes
and create proper XML-serializable proxy classes from them.
It's also the place where you probably could handle Hybernate's
lazy collections.

What I don't understand: why do you need Web Services? It seems
to be a .NET-only project where you could use Remoting instead,
which is less constrained: binary serialization can be customized
much better than XML; MarshalByRefObjects can be used to pull
data on demand from lazy collections, etc.
