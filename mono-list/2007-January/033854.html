<PRE>Thanks Miguel for the clarifications. 

I think I'll start Mono.GetOptions 2.0 (or more probably a
Commons.GetOptions) outside of Mono, and just keep Mono.GetOptions 1.0
stable (only security fixes) inside Mono svn.

I'll post details as I progress with it. But some of the ideas I already
have are:

-- to make it I18n-friendly (either gettext and resources, by
defining/using localization providers and matching tools)
-- drop the multiple constructor overloads for the attributes, in favor
of the supported syntax for field initialization by name
-- refactoring into a layered design, that should allow for imperative
definition of option sets, besides the declarative form currently
supported
-- subcommands support
-- easier runtime addition of options
-- a tool to compile a DSL (Domain Specific Language) to a binary
options library and/or generate (cia codedom) a partial classes sources
in any language taht have correct codedom support installed.
-- a GTK# GUI tool (also wrapped as a MD plugin) to write the above DSL
(some call it a graphical DSL)
-- A WinForms component/editor to define/generate/use the DSL
-- Full Monodoc/VSNET Documentation
-- Sample code also in Boo, VB.NET and Java(IKVM)

Nevertheless suggestions are welcome.

Fun

</I>&gt;<i> API additions, updates and changes are better suited to an upgraded API,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This goes to a more general issue: I think we were too lax accepting new
</I>&gt;<i> APIs that were evolving into the Mono core, which is why these days the
</I>&gt;<i> answer to &quot;Could you bundle MyFavoriteLibraryThatIJustDeveloped in Mono&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;no&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because we have to maintain backwards compatibility, this means: if you
</I>&gt;<i> break the API, we have to ship *two* versions of the library (see
</I>&gt;<i> ICSharpCode.ZipLib, we ship *two* because of this) and we have to carry
</I>&gt;<i> the burden for these API changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have documented the process to have unstable APIs in the &quot;Application
</I>&gt;<i> Deployment Guidelines&quot; on the Wiki, and many of the APIs that today we
</I>&gt;<i> ship with Mono should have gone first through that process, and only
</I>&gt;<i> when stabilized bundled with Mono.   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Bundling stuff with Mono imposes a lot of constraints on developers: API
</I>&gt;<i> stability, tests, release schedule.   But it also imposes a lot of extra
</I>&gt;<i> work on us: if a critical bug, security problem or something else is
</I>&gt;<i> found on those libraries, we must stop whatever it is that we are doing
</I>&gt;<i> and start the release process, the advisory process and get things
</I>&gt;<i> moving to address the issues.    
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is why we moved Olive into its own release schedule: because the
</I>&gt;<i> core of Mono is stable, has calcified and Olive is better served with a
</I>&gt;<i> process that has its own release schedule, that can release updates as
</I>&gt;<i> frequently as it needs (when its ready to ship) and can fix bugs on its
</I>&gt;<i> own schedule.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And this is also why we are doing it for Basic, mbas is dead, its gone
</I>&gt;<i> from the tree, and so are the class libraries for Visual Basic: the vbnc
</I>&gt;<i> and vbruntime components are younger, and need to be on their own
</I>&gt;<i> release schedule, they are moving at a different speed, and bundling
</I>&gt;<i> with Mono just imposes a structure that is not apt for technologies
</I>&gt;<i> under heavy development. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We would have done the *same* for Windows.Forms, were it not for the
</I>&gt;<i> internal dependencies in our own assemblies (ie, have Windows.Forms
</I>&gt;<i> releases that are completely independent of Mono).   
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We should have known better;   There is the rule from Brad Cox: an API
</I>&gt;<i> is not mature until you have three very different applications consuming
</I>&gt;<i> it and not until you have tests cases, understanding of limitations and
</I>&gt;<i> expanded features that you should declare it as stable.
