&gt;<i> On some other discussions here on [Mono-list], there has been talk of

Some time ago I suggested a directory like Apple's Mac OS X downloads  
(<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/">http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/</A>). Categories could include  
compilers, database connectivity, reporting. Miguel liked the idea at  
the time but it was never discussed who might host it, how it's  
developped etc.

A Mono-CAN as suggested now would probably mean hosting tons of  
binary downloads, involving a lot of work to keep it up-to-date thus  
usable, whereas a user-edited and reviewed directory would probably  
mean less maintenance work but more upfront development time...

Actually, both approaches wouldn't necessarily contradict each other  
- a Web directory is directed at users for the purpose of more easily  
finding new libraries and tools that could then be obtained either  
through an automated Mono-CAN system or through the classic  
distribution channels.

Concerning names for such a site, instead of using an abbreviation or  
acronym we could just as well call it something more literary like  
The Monkey House or Tools For Primates or whatever. ;-)
