<PRE>OK , one of those problems that shows that the Unix FS actually works.

I want to write a generic installation tool for 'publishing ' my 
projects from my development system to my server.  This requires that I 
alter the mono-server config files etc.

Easy to manually as I can sudo and do the work.  I am however a lazy 
person that would rather have myself a program that can do this for me. 
As I expected, changing the user under which a program runs is not as 
simple as just calling Syscall.setuid.  I do not want to go and change 
the access rights of the config files as I think is is good that only 
root can write to them. 

How do I get my program to, when I supply my sudo password, obtain root 
rights until it has done the changes to the program (that is short of 
the famous Unix 'glue everything together with shell\ scripts' 
solution.  I for once would like to program on Unix in a manner that my 
entire project is C# based and not a mixture of C# and shell scripting.

Any help will be appreciated

</PRE>
