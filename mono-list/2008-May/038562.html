<PRE>Hi All,

I am currently trying to port an open source wrapper I wrote for
libogg, libvorbis and libtheora to mono. All of the above libraries
are standard portable C libraries compiled as shared objects.

I currently have a wrapper for each of the three libraries written in
C#, which works correctly on windows. However when I try to use the
same wrapper with mono and linux versions of same libraries I get a
SIGSEGV error. Know the C libraries are identical as I have compiled
them myself form the same code which works on windows.

All of the marshaling my wrappers do is manual, using the Marshal
class, except for a few single value types (int &amp; doubles mostly). I
assumed I was trying to free some unmanaged memory that was currently
in use by the native library, so as I test I tried commenting out all
references to Marshal.FreeHGlobal.This hasn't stopped the SIGSEGV
error.

The Managed Stack Trace mono creates seems to point to a different
method every time. So I began to wonder if it was mono which actually
triggered the SIGSEGV error. I updated from the standard Ubuntu
packages to a third party one containing the latest release, the
problem was unchanged.

After installing the debug symbols for mono I manged to use gdb to do
a back trace. I don't know much about the internals of mono but, from
what I can tell it appears to be part of the mono garbage collector
which is causing the SIGSEGV. I have included the back trace below.

Initial frame selected; you cannot go up.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can find the cause of this
problem? There can't be too many problems with my code as the same
code runs on windows fine. Is there something particularly different
about the way mono handles unmanaged memory. Is it possible to
completely disable the garbage collector to see if that stops the
SIGSEGV error. I know its not a viable solution but it would at least
help narrow down the cause.

Any help would be greatly appreciated on this.
