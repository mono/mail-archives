I needed mono for several programs. I managed to get mono installed via yum.
Then I needed gtk-sharp and retrieved the source and tried to compile. The
file mono.pc was missing, so I searched and did not find anything but
library files for specific platforms? I decided to try the rpm's to get
additional packages. I could not download most packages since there would be
dependencies for files I could not locate. rpm mono says 'mono' is
installed, rpm mono-complete has me instaloing other packages and this is
where I ended up going down some long and windy path that had each sucessive
package needing a dependency until there were no more dependencies to be
found. 

Anybody know about this problem with the rpm dependency and why it leads to
nowhere? ALso what is up with the mono.pc file, is there not one set of
libraries to install for mono that will have this file and work?
