<PRE>Hi there and thanks for the advice,

 &gt; &gt; For the past two months we've been hosting a webservice  
application on
 &gt; &gt; apache2 and mod_mono.
 &gt; &gt; Since this week we have some real traffic, and stability issues
 &gt; &gt; started. We now have about 30.000 requests a day, these make the  
mono
 &gt; &gt; process grow in memory usage to about 2gigs. and the response  
becomes
 &gt; &gt; really bad.
 &gt; You might want to increase the thread pool size by setting the  
MONO_THREADS_PER_CPU
 &gt; environment variable to a value higher than the default 5 (the  
formula for
 &gt; calculating the number of threads in the pool is 20 +  
($MONO_THREADS_PER_CPU *
 &gt; number_of_cpus)
The application feels a bit faster now, but with a lot of traffic it  
still sometimes does not come back after the autorestart
 &gt; &gt; The memory problem is probably cause by the none compacting garbage
 &gt; &gt; collector, I solved the performance issue by doing an autorestart
 &gt; &gt; every 400 requests. This works great for a while but after a few  
auto-
 &gt; That sounds quite often - I think 1000 would be quite enough in  
your case.
With about 800 requests it uses 1.5gb of ram and the performance  
decreases..


 &gt; &gt; restarts it lookes live apache failes to spawn a new mod-mono- 
server.
 &gt; &gt; Apache respondes with a 503, when I kill the (old still running)   
mono
 &gt; &gt; process and restart apache it's back.
 &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; Suggestions?
 &gt; It's hard to determine what it is just from the description - it  
might be a
 &gt; deadlock, might be a memory issue with shared memory. Please  
compile mod_mono with
 &gt; - --enable-debug and post apache logs when the 503 happens - that  
should make it
 &gt; easier to diagnose what's going on.
I recompiled on debug, it looks like a deadlock:
