<PRE>Wish I could say that experience has given me some insight into this
question.  I've had events that I announced &quot;the day of&quot; that were
massively attended and events that I've promoted for weeks in advance that
have barely anyone show up.

I think Peter is right in that having people with more influence (like Nat
and Miguel) are a great way to promote our groups.  On the other hand if
people start to perceive them as &quot;shilling&quot; they'll lose some of that
influence.  I guess, to my mind anyway, it's like perfume--better to use
too little than too much.  I think the best thing would be for Miguel and
Nat to link to your blog post but not say anything about retweeting.  The
people that follow Miguel and Nat are likely to check out the blog post
without having to be prompted to do so anyway.

FWIW, I also share interesting stuff within my firm as well.  Rob
(Gibbens') talk about MvvmCross has already generated a bit of interest
within my company.

&gt;<i> Hey all
</I>&gt;<i> One of the first topics I wanted to raise for discussion is how Xamarin
</I>&gt;<i> can/should help promote user groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We just posted a blog post promoting most of your events this month:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-user-groups-everywhere/">http://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-user-groups-everywhere/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And we're interested in promoting meetings through other means, such as
</I>&gt;<i> our Newsletter, calendar(s) on the website, etc.  If you have other ideas
</I>&gt;<i> here, please share them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond this, we also socialize events through twitter/g+/etc.  Based on
</I>&gt;<i> your own experiences with various user groups and social networks, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> wondering if we can reach a consensus regarding the optimal lead time for
</I>&gt;<i> announcing upcoming events from our account?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Typically, we try to time these kinds of tweets about an hour before
</I>&gt;<i> lunch, or an hour before end-of-day, in the local timezone on the day
</I>&gt;<i> before, or the day of the event.  Does this seem right to you all?  Do you
</I>&gt;<i> think folks need more or less lead time to plan to attend?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks
