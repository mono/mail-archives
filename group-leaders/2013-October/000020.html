<PRE>Hello Xamarin Group Leaders!

A few of you might have seen my name around the Xamarin forums, chat rooms,
or on Twitter. If you haven&#8217;t, I am James Montemagno and I recently started
here at Xamarin as a Developer Evangelist. I wanted to reach out and
introduce myself and see how all of the User Groups were doing.

I have been a .NET developer for over a decade now in many different
development industries. Over the past two years I have spent my time
dedicated to mobile .NET applications using Xamarin Technology. Even though
I am located in Seattle, Washington, one of my top priorities as an
evangelist for Xamarin is to be extremely active in the community and user
groups everywhere. I am here to ensure you have everything that you need
for your local communities to expand and thrive.

I have gone through the entire archive and read most of your introductions
and I am extremely interested to see how everything has been going over the
past few months with your user groups. I am curious to see what has been
working well for you and what could we be doing to help you make it even
better.

I look forward to hearing from everyone and hopefully getting to meet some
of you very soon. Feel free to reach out to me here via email or on Twitter
@JamesMontemagno.

Cheers,

James Montemagno

Developer Evangelist, Xamarin Inc.
