It can and does happen -- just rotate your device and watch the activity get destroyed and recreated. It's trivial to test. :-)

What if you're in the middle of editing? It's up to you to store the data &quot;elsewhere&quot; so that it isn't lost. Might I suggest the Application [0, 1] instance (which _is_ &quot;global&quot; in that there's only one instance ever created for a process), and can be obtained from the Context.ApplicationContext property, though you could add a &quot;hack&quot; to make the Application instance truly global [1].

Furthermore, you should note that in Android the Activity is _not_ the application itself; it's a _screen_ in the app. For example, with &quot;panel&quot;-style apps (the Settings app, the Email app, etc.), each &quot;screen&quot; is usually a separate Activity, and it's common to navigate between the screens by using Activity.StartActivity(), and pressing the Back button will return you to the previously running Activity in an &quot;activity stack&quot; [2].

&gt;<i> Is there an easier way to instantly get a reference to Context? All I want
</I>&gt;<i> is to load an Asset using external code without worrying about it too much.
</I>
If you follow the technique in [1], you'll have access to an Application instance from global context (MyApp.Instance), and since Application is a Context subclass, this should work for you.

Note that this can also be placed on a class, and will register the adorned class as the single Application instance to create, e.g.:

	[Application]
	public class MyApp : Android.App.Application {

		// Yes, this is required, though it's one of the few places an (IntPtr) constructor is required.
		public MyApp(IntPtr handle)
			: base (handle)
		{
			Instance = this;
		}

		public static MyApp Instance {get; private set;}

		// other members...
	}
