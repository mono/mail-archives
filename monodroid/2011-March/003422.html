<PRE>With OnPause/OnResume you're asked to save your app's state somewhere and
resume it later, and while doing that you can re-cache the global reference
to the main activity. 
The app's state can be worked out if it is possible to save and restore .NET
objects. I'm still not sure how well it's going to work...

As for your question, I have no direct access to a View either. Currently
I'm caching a reference to the main activity in a global static variable
located in a class library. This allows other parts of the code to load
assets without having to know about Android.
I'm still playing with it, looking for better ways though.	


Regards,
Amir

OnPause/OnResume.  Your activity needs to know how to reload itself.
This includes the user jumping to other apps and potentially coming back
to your activity at a later time.  You activity can get blown away at
any time for resource issues, etc...

You many want to take a look at:

<A HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/activities.html">http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/activities.html</A>

There's a fairly extension discussion of lifecycle on that page.

Where are you doing this?  &quot;External code&quot; is a bit vague.  If it's in a
view in response to an event or listener callback, View.Context will
give you the current context.
