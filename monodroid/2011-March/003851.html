<PRE>Since Preview 14 the debugger is faster for me. I had slow responses with
Preview 13 though.

 

Here are a few tips of what I did:

1. Give a priority to the MAC address of the device in your router. It's not
always possible though.

2. Stop using the 'Watch' because it slows down everything. If you have
several expressions there, it will cause a serious delay, so every time you
set a watch for an expression, remember to remove it right after.

3. I bet the Locals window is another issue because it tries to fetch them
for every step, although as I see it, it's faster than the 'Watch'.

4. Don't use the emulator because it's much slower than debugging on a
device.

 

Problems that I've encountered so far:

1. I also get many &quot;The expression evaluation took too long&quot; messages.

2. Sometimes I can't get an indexed item in an array like mylist[i] (opposed
to mylist[1] that works). 

3. Although I see improvement, the debugger is still slow. I have to clear
watched items which is annoying, and so on...

 

 

 

Regards,

Amir

Thanks for the reply. Your description is similar to what I've seen, though
lately I very rarely get anything other than &quot;took too long&quot; messages.

 

Since you mentioned the emulator I thought I'd try debugging on a device,
which I hadn't tried previously - I figured it might be just the emulator
that was slow. Unfortunately I'm getting very similar results there.

 

Has there been any official word on this from the Monodroid team?

Jon,

 

I often see the same thing.

 

Sometimes variable values are shown, but it takes a long time (eg. half a
minute). Other times it just gives the &quot;The expression evaluation took too
long&quot; message or there's no message and it's clearly given up trying.

 

Sometimes in the Locals window the first batch of variable values are shown
fine, the remainder have the &quot;too long&quot; message.

 

FWIW I'm always debugging using the emulator.

I'm experiencing this as well, nearly two months later, but I haven't heard
anyone else talking about it. I can't find it in Bugzilla either.

 

So I guess I'd like the same quick sanity check Nathan requested - is this a
known issue? Or is there something wrong with my MonoDroid installation?

Hey all,

 

I know that performance has been on the list for a while now, but I wanted
to have a quick sanity check.  Right now, my debugger is essentially useless
for me.  Every request in the watch window or via hovering over variables
while stopped will result in a timeout.  Is this the behavior that everyone
else is experiencing?  The break points hit just fine, but I can't get any
values from a stopped point due to errors like this:

 

Watch Window

 

Name:  item.GetType()                

Value:Unable to evaluate the expression. The expression evaluation took too
long. 

 

 

Currently my workaround is that I write everything to console.  Feels almost
like the old Javascript debugging days.  :)   The big downside here is that
I am waiting 3-5 mins between each build which makes debugging SLOW.  What
should take 10 mins of testing to fix is now taking up to an hour.

 

Anyone else having better luck than I on this?

 

Nathan
