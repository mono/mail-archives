<PRE>It's running Android 2.2 so that can't be the problem.

I wish I could zip my project. Unfortunately this is production code which
is too complex anyway. I don't know where to begin with reproducing these
errors in a sample project. 

I guess we're having similar problems here. Can you describe when your code
is crashing? Do you dynamically remove and add views in the same activity,
manipulate multiple objects in memory in one action or use attributes
extensively?


Thanks for sharing,
Amir

If your Galaxy S is running Android 2.1, Samsung shipped the base image with
a buggy kernel that doesn't play nice with m4a. Getting an upgrade to
Android 2.2 is about the only fix for that problem... or using a different
device. :p

Though if that isn't the issue, I've been having similar problems, and have
been struggling to put together a repro project for the dev team. If the
above issue isn't what you're running into, could you zip up your project
and attach it to a bug report?

Thanks,
Sam Lippert

Subject: [mono-android] The program 'Mono' has exited with code 255 (0xff).

Lately, I've started testing my code and I'm seeing Mono for Android
crashing too many times without a warning.

Scenario: I click on buttons many times till the application crashes. No
exception is caught!

Visual Studio's Output window shows:
In mgmain JNI_OnLoad
...
The program 'Mono' has exited with code 255 (0xff).



While trying to locate the so called bugs in the '...' lines that I removed,
I couldn't find anything wrong. There are many calls that change properties
of objects stored in memory.

Can you try and help what is wrong here?

1) The code is dynamically removing and adding Android views to the same
activity (is that wrong in Mono/Android terms?)
2) The code changes many 'Text' properties of C# objects stored in memory.
This for example is a result of translating them to another language after
they've been loaded.

To sums things up, I get the feeling that I'm either doing something
generally wrong (for example, working extensively with one Activity), or
there's some instability with the way Mono for Android handles memory.

One last thing, I'm running the same code on a PC and everything works
perfectly well. I checked Android's CPU and memory usage before this
happens. CPU is not stressed at all, and memory usage is about 25MB which on
my device reached up to 50MB without crashing before.

Samsung Galaxy S , Preview 14.

Thank you for your comments!

Amir
