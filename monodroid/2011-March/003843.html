<PRE>Hi Jonathan
What I mean is that a particular axml file causes visual studio to hang on
the FindViewByID
Obviously visual studio can only render the axml when it debugs but I cant
get that far.
The same xml renders in droiddraw and eclipse (because they have a visual
designer)- I struggle with Java and haven't tried getting as far as
debugging in Eclipse. I presume if it renders there it's ok

What I found was that if I took out the second tablelayout (sequential not
nested) then it worked in Visual studio. I tried with a nested table layout
and it worked at first as I reported below but I spoke too  soon - it is now
hanging on the base:oncreate() line 
Returning to the one table layout in the xml I can get it to work = indeed
it seems to work with any simple axml without much content. I wonder if it
is the content rather than the table layout.
Despite this pointing to an issue with VS and tablelayouts in xml, the
erratic nature of the problem suggests it may be my machine and VS set up. I
am hoping to transfer all  to another PC with a load of memory (6g v 4g ) to
see what happens. 
Fwiw I frequently get hangs on the emulator and I have to close down VS to
restore normal operation (not that it is an unrecoverable hang just that if
you cancel the debug, the next debug never works unless you close VS)

Exactly 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If that's the case, could you try using that XML with a Java project,
</I>on device?
See above

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As far as I know, Mono for Android isn't doing anything special with
</I>the XML, we're (currently) just passing it as-is to `aapt` &amp; co., so this
_shouldn't_ behave any differently between a Mono for Android app &amp; a Java
app, on device...

That's why I suspect it is probably a machine specific memory issue

Will report after further tests
For information currently running on a Toshiba r700 laptop 2,4ghz with 4g
memory win 7
I can't see that that is poor - but one never knows - the emulator is pretty
awful anyway
