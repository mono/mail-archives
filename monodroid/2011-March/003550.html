Yes, there is support for WCF, REST, and direct database connectivity in MonoDroid.  The stories are:
WCF.  Connecting to a WCF Service works the same as it does in Monotouch with one addition.  the one addition is that the WCF proxy can be generated for you in MDr.  This isn't possible in MonoTouch due to the runtime limiations in the iPhone.  WCf support is still listed as experimental, so there are a lot of WS* features that aren't there.  Basic http binding works properly as far as I know.  I've done async and it works properly.
REST.  Callling REST services works.  I've got examples using GET and POST.  These examples use XML and System.JSON.  LINQ to XML and &quot;LINQ to JSON&quot; is working allow you to easily turn text into objects.  I've done asyncon this as well and it works well.
Database support is a little more spotty.  This is due to the requirements of having a data provider running in MDr.  There is a Mono.Data.TDS assembly that is used for Sql Server connectivity and is included in the box so that you can use.  I've used it to connect to a sql server database.  I;ve pulled data back in a datareader.  Jon Pryor says that there is a bug that keeps datasets from working.  Getting to antoher db is harder.  I think that here is support for some other database using some custom providers, but these are rare right now.  This is listed as experimental, so I'm sure that there are some features that don't work perfectly, but you should be able to get at the basics.  If you want to connect to oracle, db/2, or other database, in the absence of a provider, you can connect to the sql server and then used a linked server in sql server to connect up remotely to the database.
Hope that helps some. :-)
