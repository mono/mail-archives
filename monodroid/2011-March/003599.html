<PRE>Hey folks 

 

An initial sounding out here ... is anyone interested in the AndEngine &lt;<A HREF="http://www.andengine.org/">http://www.andengine.org/</A>&gt;  2D game engine ported over to monodroid?  

 

I started converting it a couple of weeks ago, without realising how big it is.  I&#8217;m probably now between a third and a half of the way through it, and I think I may be nearing a buildable version of the core engine components.  There have been many interesting challenges such as lack of support for co-variance in C#, methods in structs in the java source, static package references and methods in enums, and other such C# incompatible features, but I think I&#8217;ve got most of the major puzzles cracked now.  It&#8217;s been a great learning experience including threading, synchronisation, advanced data-structures and platform support for inheritance features, etc..  If you are not confident (or are at least ready and willing to learn) regarding translating that level of code, then best to wait for the alpha/beta release of the engine.  I&#8217;m testing my limits on these areas, but seem to be swimming so far, but I can definitely not afford to be guiding people much here.

 

Does anyone fancy joining me on this project, want to recommend the best place to host the code and project, suggest conversion tools and references, etc.?  As the source is under an LGPL license I am intending to release this code under LGPL, with my own game running on it as a demo, and hopefully to release it in time for the monodroid release.  I&#8217;ve never participated in open source development before, though I am an experienced developer professionally, so guidance on planning and running this project are welcomed as well as any assistance with the code.  FYI, I am currently managing my code within Git, so Git open source hosting would likely be the most relevant here.  I can handle a few merges if required and commented properly.

 

Anyone interested in this initial alpha/beta development please reply here, and I will try to resolve a shared repository and some sort of tracker for issues if not included in that hosting, and we can then try to nail this.  If anyone is thinking &#8220;fantastic idea&#8221; and has experience of running these projects, please feel free to liaise with me to consider taking charge of this if you&#8217;d rather, as I am happy either way so long as my name is alongside the key project notes.

 

Otherwise I hope to notify you all when it is released with a link, examples, market link to my game, etc.

 

Any takers?

 

Regards,

Thank you Morton, that does nearly the job. But now the application closes with &#8222;Sorry, the application closes unexpected&#8220;.

 

Regards,

Carlo

In that case, try this;

 

List&lt;IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt; groupData = new List&lt;IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;();

List&lt;IList&lt;IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;&gt; childData = new List&lt;IList&lt;IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;&gt;();

&#8230;

Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt; curGroupMap = new Dictionary&lt;string, object&gt;();

&#8230;

groupData.Add(curGroupMap);

&#8230;

new SimpleExpandableListAdapter(this, groupData, &#8230;)

&#8230;

 

This is what I meant when I said you had to make your list agree with using interfaces.

 

  -- Cheers, Morten

Hm,

 

I am not really sure what to do.

I just want to port this example <A HREF="http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/view/ExpandableList3.html">http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/view/ExpandableList3.html</A> to monodroid.

 

The problem is that the SimpleExpandableListAdapter want the interfaces for the &#8222;groupData&#8220; and &#8222;childData&#8220; lists.

 

            // Now the app dies here

SimpleExpandableListAdapter expListAdapter =

                new SimpleExpandableListAdapter(

                    this, groupData as IList&lt;IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;&gt;,
