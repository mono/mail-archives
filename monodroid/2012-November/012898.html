<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>thank you for your peace of code, and sorry that i'm posting back only now.

i am figuring out at the moment how it works(yeah do not only C&amp;P even if i
can't really understand it atm.) and how i implement it.

i have a problem with this one:
SafeUnregisterReceiver

this method seems to be nowhere in all the android resources and is nowhere
to be found in the documentation...or am i blind?

Ps: IntentService:
Am i right that this service starts, when you call it, starts an worker
threat and stops it when the threat is finished? would that mean it can't
store any data? 

i want the service to store data from an Database, so i do not have to do
SQL queries all the time.
from this temporary storage i want to call just an singe cursor (i have 4 or
5) from an activity 
the called data will be manipulated and send back by that activty, which can
happen more than once with every cursor. 
at the end of the service all data should be writen back in the DB by
altering...deleting...or inserting entries.
this will be not to hard, (at least i think it will be), and i hope i wont
need help with that, 
just want you to tell what i plan to do... but you could tell me if this
idea of managing data is crap or not,
wheter i should do sth like that, or just do all the stuff direcly in the DB
(which would be less programming)
