<PRE>Hi Jon,

&gt;&gt;<i> I seem to have hit a snag. An app I'm working on for a bit of fun creates an XML file with bits of information in needed for the next time it's run. However, on a small number of phones, it dies leaving the file open.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there a way I can check on the state of this file the next time the app is run and if it's open, close it before it's used?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems...odd. Mono disabled shared file handles in Mono 2.8 [0]; Mono for Android is based on Mono 2.10, and likewise should not support cross-process shared file handles. The only process you should be able to have problems sharing handles with is itself, and if the process exited (&quot;dies&quot;), that shouldn't be a problem.
</I>
The file isn't a shared file as such. It simply contains some XML that 
records information about the phone

&gt;<i> Is it possible for you to create a reproducible test case and file a bug for this?
</I>
Not really as it's not really a bug. An app dies during saving the file 
and so the file is not closed.

Thanks

Paul

vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a 
long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to
