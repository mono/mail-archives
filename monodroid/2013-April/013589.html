<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Yesterday i installed 4.6.02001. Before, I worked a long time with 4.2.7, so
I don't have experiences with releases between.

Now i'm facing long build- &amp; packaging-times. Build takes 60+ sec. /
packaging (incl. copy to device) 70+ sec (in debug-mode).
I never stopped buildtime on 4.2.7....but it is a huge difference.
A further thing is, that mono everytime runs through packaging, even if no
sourcecode was changed since the last build. that always takes 70+ sec. 
under 4.2.7 the deployment started immediately, if no source was changed.

next further thing:
under 4.2.7 the build-process was very fast, if only a few sourcecode files
were changed and no changes in android-recourses were done. now, it always
takes the whole time of 60+ sec. for the build.

package-size:
the package-size under debug increases from ~500kb (4.2.7) to now ~1000kb.
the package-size under release is (blessedly) almost the same.

strange behavior in debug-mode (only when debugger is connected):
the debugger internally stopped at a codeline and didn't go further.
I hit pause &amp; F5 several times, the debugger always stood on the same
codeline (it was not in a loop ;).

this is the codeline:
int versuche = (Programm.PartialDownloadTrysBeforeError &gt; 0) ?
Programm.PartialDownloadTrysBeforeError : 1;

PartialDownloadTrysBeforeError is declared in a static partial class:

public static partial class Programm
{
   ...
   public static int PartialDownloadTrysBeforeError = 3; 
   ...

when the debugger is not connected, the code is performed without problems.

conclusion:
is it normal, that build &amp; packaging takes so long? what can I do to speed
up the process.
Usually I do 20-30 debug-builds per day. you can calculate how much
additional time i have to spend at work to get set same things done :-(

why does the package-size of the debug-build increases so much?

You have an idea, why debugger stops at the codeline above?

Hope, somebody can help me!
