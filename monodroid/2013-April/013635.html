</I>&gt;<i> GALAXY Y DUOS S6102...r they support to install my apps..both mobiles are
</I>&gt;<i> android version 2.3 ginger bread ...plz reply asap
</I>
Ok, couple of things spring to mind

1. Do you have the device to install apps from other locations? This is 
a setting on the device itself rather than in monodroid.

2. Have you got the device to allow debugging set? This can be a reason 
why you're getting the adb error (in your reply to Jon)

3. Which version of monodroid are you using? If it's not a newer 
version, then deploying in either Debug or Release isn't enabled. Newer 
versions have a timer so you can try for 30 days.

To install apps onto my Nexus, I have the following set

(on the device)
Security-&gt;Unknown sources ticked
Developer options -&gt; USB Debugging (ticked)
Developer options -&gt; Verify apps over USB (ticked)

plug it in, build and it just deploys directly over USB. I'm on a Mac so 
didn't need to mess with the drivers, but this is typically what I set 
to connect *any* device over USB on my Mac. Win7 usually picks up the 
correct drivers and installs them. I say usually, it got badly mixed up 
on my HTC wildfire. What a fun 3 hours of time wasted *that* was ;)

Try those settings and see if it will deploy. It could be that your 
install of the Android SDK is messed up as well. It may be worth 
removing it and reinstalling as a precaution.

vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a 
long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to 
space, listen...&quot;
