<PRE>Hello all,

Glad xamarin is now alive and wish you good luck with your job, hope also
someone could give a review of my problem and comment my questions.

Our main interest in monodroid is that we have wellestablished .net WM
application with quite big and complex 'business' logic codebase. For sure
we would like to review the opportunity to keep as much c# code shared as we
can.

The core of our .net &quot;library&quot; makes some heavy calculations/processings
(which are quite platform independent) and require relatively intensive data
throughoutput.

Our current idea is to keep this library running in monodroid as an android
service (and by this share the main &quot;heavy&quot; buisness logic code between
WM/android projects), and to create a UI wrapper. (it most probably will be
in native java).

Service should interact with Bluetooth hardware (taking the input data), and
give the output data to the UI part (for display, etc).

Therefore there are two questions:

Is it possible to work with android BT API directly from monodroid code? How
efficient it'll be in terms of data transfers? I mean since monodroid
creates wrappers for Input/Output-Streams (does it?) how well stream.read
and stream.write will map data? The amounts of data is not high (several
bytes), but the request/response rate with BT hardware is required to be as
fast as possible. (normally its up to 50Hz). Won't read/write serialization
between dalvik/mono be a bottleneck here?

Second question is service &lt;-&gt; UI interaction part. Normally this is done
with AIDL in java.. I haven't found any words on aidl support in monodroid.
Guess it could be implemented 'manually' - is there any experience exist in
this area?

  Igor
