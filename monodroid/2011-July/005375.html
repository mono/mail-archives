While I think we all want a better design time layout solution, this is an issue that we can work around short/medium term.  For me, the debugger and the performance are issues #1 and #1, by a long shot.  I did a talk back at the beginning of May on mobile at a high level.  Two guys that work at a company I am familiar with said that they had looked at mono for android and decided to not not use monotouch and mono for android because of the debugger in monodroid.  Would it have been a huge sale?  I don't know, but it would have been a mono design win and it would have been a win for me/us as well as they would have been interested in our training.  If these problems had been fixed, would the sale have been made? I'm not sure, but I know that this company was using .NET for their development so I think it had a good possibility.
I'd definitely add Amir's suggestion of stability as well to mine.  I have seen exceptions occur with no warning and messaging as well.

Subject: Re: [mono-android] wishlist



I actually create the layouts in eclipse and copies the result to my VS project. It&#8217;s a bit clumsy, but it works&#8230; --Rune From: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodroid">monodroid-bounces at lists.ximian.com</A> [mailto:<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodroid">monodroid-bounces at lists.ximian.com</A>] On Behalf Of Mark Berry

Subject: [mono-android] wishlist With the good news regarding the status of Monotouch and Mono for Android, its time for my M4A short term wishlist:Getting the debugger working.  Debugging applications is an integral part of what developers do.  Debugging in Visual Studio has got to be improved.Performance.  It seems that apps written in M4A seem to run really slowly in comparison java apps running on android.
Medium term would be honeycomb and tablet support along with mapping.
