<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Our current idea is to keep this library running in monodroid as an
</I>&gt;<i> android service (and by this share the main &quot;heavy&quot; buisness logic code
</I>&gt;<i> between WM/android projects), and to create a UI wrapper. (it most probably
</I>&gt;<i> will be in native java).
</I>&gt;<i> Using Mono for Android to create a UI wrapper makes sense, but why do you
</I>&gt;<i> want to run your library as an Android service?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We don't want to 'reimplement' our whole business logic in java - thats why
we are looking into mono-android.
We also have a requirement for our app to work as a service (collecting data
from BT device in background, without UI).
Therefore, a separation between ui-app and service is quite natural (plus
this allows external apps/plugins to attach to the service for data
fetching).
We also don't have problems with using java in contrast with popular trend
&quot;hey I hate java(read: don't want to learn) but love .net, thats why I love
monodroid&quot;. Therefore I prefer 'native' solution where it is possible (and
use java for UI).

it is _not_ the thread you want to be doing high data throughput  algorithms
&gt;<i> on that thread, as it would lock up your UI. You want to use some background
</I>&gt;<i> thread (e.g. a dedicated System.Threading.Thread) instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thats for sure.
BTW, could you give some insight into System.Threading.Thread usage.. As I
understand monodroid arch now - for dalvik its a kind of JNI layer (working
eventually as a .net vm). How then its possible to run native .net threads
in there? How you can run both mono and dalvik in a same linux process? Or
may be you don't?


&gt;<i> &gt; How efficient it'll be in terms of data transfers?
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know. Unfortunately, you would need to profile. Furthermore, I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know if the emulator emulates bluetooth or not; you may need to
</I>&gt;<i> profile on actual hardware to see what the overhead is (and you'd probably
</I>&gt;<i> want actual hardware anyway to see if it's fast enough).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I see.
Emulator has no BT support, but we can create a Socket connection with host
machine, which'll emulate our device (or even tunnel via tcp socket to real
device).


As mentioned above, I'm not sure you want to use a Service here. That said,
&gt;<i> there is currently no built-in support for AIDL files. If necessary, you
</I>&gt;<i> could probably hack something together by invoking the aidl compiler as a
</I>&gt;<i> pre-build step and including the Java sources (both generated and
</I>&gt;<i> potentially hand-written) into the final app by using the AndroidJavaSource
</I>&gt;<i> build action, then using Android.Runtime.JNIEnv to interact with the Java
</I>&gt;<i> types. We intend on improving AIDL support in a future release, but there is
</I>&gt;<i> no timeframe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is what I meant, yes. Ultimately it should be possible to generate c#
AIDL interface stubs and autogenerate all underlying jni code. Tough task.
