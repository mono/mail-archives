<PRE>I am currently trying to create a renderer that uses opengl ES 2.0 to draw
various primitives and textures. I have created a class that subclasses
AndroidGameView, I am creating an instance of that view in my main activity
and adding it to the layout. I have been successful in rendering graphics
into the game view.

The problem occurs when I attempt to move to a new activity and back. Upon
restarting the original activity and creating a new instance of my
AndroidGameView subclass (Run() is called in the constructor), the
AndroidGameView run loop does not appear to restart as evidenced by
OnRenderFrame never getting called again. The surface is created on restart
because I do get a call to SurfaceCreated, but OnRenderFrame is never called
again. All examples I have seen for AndroidGameView implementation have
started the run loop once and depended on the application exiting to end the
loop so I am not sure if I can do what I am trying to do.

Is it possible to restart the run loop successfully without exiting the
application? It seems like this should be possible since, with Android, you
cannot rely on the OS not killing your view when it is stopped or paused.
Just wondering if this could be the result of a bug in AndroidGameView or if
I am just using it incorrectly.

Thanks
