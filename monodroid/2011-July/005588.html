<PRE>This are both great ideas.

Mono's strength is unifying the platforms.  Playing nice with PhoneGap would be a great first step I think.

Though ultimately I think a Silverlight View layer that can be built on all major platforms would be ideal.  Pretty much rewriting PhoneGap in Silverlight/C#.

Best regards,
Kervin

Have you looked at <A HREF="https://github.com/chrisntr/MonoMobile.Extensions?">https://github.com/chrisntr/MonoMobile.Extensions?</A> I believe it does what you describe as 'MonoGap'.

Guys,

Sorry if this is not a really 'new' idea, but it crossed my mind these days
and I would like some feedback from you.

The problem is: how to build an app that could work on Android, iOS (the
mainstream) and perhaps other platforms? Ok, we have Mono for iOS and Mono
for Android, but what about the UI? They are really different among
platforms.

On the other side we have a 'partial' solution: WebApps written in any Web
Framework (Sencha Touch, JQuery Mobile, etc) and PhoneGap to build a
'native' app. The problem with this approach is that the JavaScript is
limited and if you want to introduce anything new, you have to create a
native class for iOS, Android, etc. So, you are maintaing many different
sources again.

I thought if we could do something like this:

- The View: The application would be a WebApp, like those we would create
with any Web Framework, running in the WebView component. Ok, it's not
'native', but changing the CSS file it can look very close to native under
any platform, with the same objects.

- 'MonoGap': it would be amazing if we could create a class library for iOS
and other for the Android called for example 'MonoGap' that we could
reference in our application. This library would give access to a 'MonoGap'
namespace in the WebApp with calls for Accelerometer, GPS, Camera, etc.

- The Controller: pure C# classes we write under Mono that gets accessible
to the WebApp through a custom namespace. Actually, it's like PhoneGap does,
but it would be our custom code.

- The Model: also, pure C# classes to handle the data under Mono, whatever
data source it is, local, remote, object, relational, etc, etc.

With this kind of approach, we could really build powerful applications,
because all the application logic (calculations, data management,
communications, etc), could be done with C# code, under Mono, shared among
all platforms, and the UI could also be the same. Debugging would be easy,
as all the complex logic would be under Mono.

What are your thoughts?

Marcio Alexandroni.
