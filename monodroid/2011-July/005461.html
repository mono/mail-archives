</I>&gt;<i> &#183;       I had a tight loop calling RunOnUiThread to update an activity when performing a background task. For a long-running task this sometimes caused a crash (NB. not an application level exception, just the usual &quot;app has died&quot;). Suppose this tried to perform 5,000 UI updates in 1 minute - 80% of the time the app would crash doing this. I changed the updates to be only 10% of this - app has never crashed since. The crash was always associated with a GC_EXPLICIT in the logs.

Have you filed a bug for this? If not, could you?

&gt;<i> &#183;       I had a number of activities using StartActivityForResult. At seemingly-random times in the activity lifecycle the app would die. I changed the app to hold a reference to each activity globally, in order to inhibit the GC (not a good idea I know). This increased reliability significantly. To me it &quot;felt&quot; like activities were being GC'd before OnDestroy was called, but that's guesswork.

Have you filed this as well? A repro would be nice, but this seems more random...

Thanks,
