<PRE>I've been using Mono for Android now for a week because our current code
base is in .Net. However.  I've come up with a couple of issues, if
someone could please help answer.

 

1.  I'm trying to get the MacAddress using the .net
System.Net.NetworkInformation.NetworkInterface.GetAllNetworkInterfaces()
)

 and it errors, according to  the log.  Does this work?  The code logic
works on my PC but not on the Android.

 

2.  Is there a way to see logging continuously like when using Eclipse?
I cannot seem to get the log monitor to tail the contents, I have to
click refresh, refresh, fresh?  Or is it that way?

 

3.  Auto start when powered on crashes when trying to set an application
to auto start.  At least in my application and the simple 'hello world'
application I used to prove power on doesn't work.  Is this a known
issue, or is it me?

 

4.  Is there a Windows emulator for Apple iOS?  I really don't want to
buy a MAC nor do I have desire to tackle that learning curve.  I'd just
like to test in an emulator on my PC for Apple and then figure out how
to deploy. 

 

5.  Has anyone had any issues on certain devices, meaning Samsung,
Motorola, etc.  What I looking for is a document of known hardware
issues which can be avoided between different manufactures.  Anything
like that around?

            a.  Tablet units.  Our application will really be used more
on tablets than say a phone.  So any issues on tablets I should be aware
of?
