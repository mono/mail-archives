<PRE>Hello everyone,

I'm the organizer of the Philly ALT.NET group and we run a track at the
semi-annual Philly.NET Code Camp which is one of the largest - if not the
largest - code camps in the US, with 800+ registrants, and 500+ attendees.

I'm always looking to &quot;push the envelope&quot; at code camp since it tends to be
very heavy on the standard MS content, but it's been getting a little more
difficult since &quot;ALT.NET&quot; is almost pass&#233; now, and many of the original
ideas are no longer very edgy, and there just doesn't seem to be much energy
left there (at least that's how it feels from my vantage point).

However, I had a great time at Monospace this past weekend (thanks Dale,
Louis, and everyone!) and definitely felt inspired by the energy and
innovation going on in the Mono community.  I would really like to make my
track (5 80-minute sessions in total) focused on Mono this year, and I'm
looking for folks that are interested in coming to Philly to speak on
Saturday, October 15th!

All topics will be considered, but the majority of this audience is pretty
mainstream, so intro-level is usually good (though some advanced talks are
fine), and I think there would be a lot of interest in things like
Android/iOS/Mobile and the web space.  Also, something like a &quot;Why You
Should Care/Learn About Mono&quot; would be a great opener.  I'm thinking of it
as a little mini-conference within the code camp to get people excited about
Mono.

If anyone would like to submit a talk, please email me off-list to discuss.
 A title, short bio/background, and short abstract is all we need to get
started.  There is also a general call for speakers that will likely open up
in a few weeks or so even if we get more good submissions than I can fit in
my track, there are multiple other web and mobile tracks that would likely
be very interested (Greg Shackles did a very well-received Mono for Android
talk in the Mobile track last year, we're negotiating with his people to
bring him back again).

Mono developers, contributors, and of course Xamarin folks are all welcome!
 Philly weather is even pretty nice in October, so you can make a weekend
out of it.

Miguel, we discussed this after the first Monospace, and you said you wanted
to come down to Philly &quot;sometime.&quot; ;-)  I'm holding you to it!  Here's your
perfect opportunity! :)

Looking forward to it!

Brian
