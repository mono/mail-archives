<PRE>It's sad about MonoDroid. Let's hope for the best.

I just wanted to let you know that I went ahead with another product for
programming Android-applications, namely Basic4Android by Anywhere Software.
In the past I used another products or their, namely Basic4PPC, when
developing for Windows Mobile.

Basic4Android is very complete and it doesn't create any runtimes that must
be distributed with the APKs - all code written in the IDE, in its VB.Net
dialect, is converted into pure Java when compiled. It's easy to pick up and
there is no need for messing with XML. It has its own designer and much
more. Try it, especially if you are not that &quot;familiar&quot; with Java like I am.
Best of all, it costs very little compared to other products, even compared
to MonoDroid. I paid USD 99,00 for 2 years of free updates and in the last
six months there has already been 3 major updates.

I am not working for Anywhere Software but I must admit they have produced a
super-product and with a huge and helpful community-forum. If you decide to
join, I will see you there.
