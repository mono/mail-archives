<PRE>Hi Jon,

Re.: Aside: &lt;uses-library/&gt; is to make use of Dalvik libraries that are
already present on the device, such as Google Maps. You should _not_ use
&lt;uses-library/&gt; for any other purpose.

Ok, thanks for clearing this up!


Re.: This is where I'm confused. The stackoverflow issue was that you were
getting a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError; the above suggests an error within
mandroid.

Yes, that's what I got initially but moved to the error reported now.
Removing that &lt;uses-library/&gt; from the manifest got me back to the
Java.Lang.NoClassDefFoundError as reported at StackOverflow.


Re.: Based on the above error message, it looks like mandroid can't find a
dependent assembly, e.g it's processing A.dll, A.dll references B.dll, and
B.dll can't be found. (In the above case, B.dll would be
Steema.TeeChart.TChart.dll.)

Yes, exactly. That's the problem.


Re.: If that is the problem, the solution is to add an assembly reference in
your project to Steema.TeeChart.TChart.dll, so that mandroid can find it. If
that isn't the solution, I'm afraid that you'll need to file a bug report,
attaching your project, so that I can investigate further. :-(

I have a reference to that assembly in the project references section. Given
the problem is NoClassDefFoundError again what do you suggest. Should I send
something that you can run to reproduce the problem at your end?


Glad this mailing list is at work again :). Thanks!
