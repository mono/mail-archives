Our abort() code also prints a stack trace/etc. to the console, and on Android the console is hooked up to `adb logcat`, which is why Greg Shackles can see the stack trace. This is useful, though it could be improved.

I spoke with Kumpera about adding more exception support instead of just aborting as well, and it's a hard problem. The runtime team has done that for some error conditions, but doing it for all conditions will take a lot of effort; it certainly won't be entirely done by next release. :-)

&gt;<i> From what I remember, Miguel was saying this was a common problem and we definitely aim to fix as many of these cases as we can.

Absolutely, we aim to fix as many as we can, but it'll take time.

In the meantime, there's `adb logcat`. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.
