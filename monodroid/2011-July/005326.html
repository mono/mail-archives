Managed code is not converted into Java, it is executed atop the Mono VM. This has a number of benefits (proper generics, anyone? Full System.Reflection.Emit?), though introduces a few issues as well.

Java code is also generated during the build process, but these Android Callable Wrappers are _not_ a translation of C# code into Java code, they're Java type declarations to allow Android code to call into managed code.

Again, this is not what happens with Mono for Android. C# code is not converted to Java.

&gt;&gt;<i> Basically like .net interprets IL, Java interprets

.NET doesn't interpret IL, .NET JIT compiles and executes IL. There's a rather large difference there. :-)

Modern JVMs also JIT compile, but support interpretation as well. I have no idea if Dalvik is a &quot;modern&quot; JVM in this respect, though I do know that Android 2.2 introduced a JIT compiler (prior to that dalvik bytecode was interpreted).

That said, Dalvik is NOT a JVM. (It doesn't interpret Java bytecode, doesn't fully support JNI, and is nowhere near as mature as Oracle's JVM. It's not as old as Mono, for that matter...)

I have no idea where VB.NET came in; VB.NET is not currently supported by Mono for Android.
