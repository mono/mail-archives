<PRE>Miguel,

Thank you for the clarity - I think we're all really excited by what MonoTouch and now MonoDroid can do for us so I'd totally support &quot;fabulous&quot; as a target.

Regards,

Mike

Subject: Re: [Monodroid] MonoBerry / Blackberry support

Today a couple of questions came up:

* Are we working on Mono for Blackberry?
* Are we working on Mono for Symbian?

The answer to both is no.   We are currently focused on delivering a great experience for Mono on Android.   It will be a top-notch solution, and this requires work, polish, time and to manually groom our work until it can graduate from nice to fabulous.

Working on any other platform at this point would prevent us from graduating to fabulous.   We would merely be passable.

Once both MonoTouch and MonoDroid are both fabulous and we feel they are both perfect, we can evaluate new platforms.

Miguel
