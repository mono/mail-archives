+1 on your thoughts.  I've been asking the same in the IRC.
 
if I understand things correctly, very little optimization has been done at this point.  Expect to see optimization coming in the future.
 
Regarding the runtime, there is the option of binding the runtime with the application, similar to how it has been done with monotouch.  It has a few bugs at this time so its not usable right now.  I am assuming that this will be resolved in the future.  On the subject of binding the runtime to the application, i wonder if there is someway to detect whether or not the runtime exists and to install it if the runtime doesn't exist on the device.

Subject: [Monodroid] Size of Monodroid applications






I am just getting started looking at Monodroid. To compare, I wrote a simple ToDo app in both Java and C# and have been comparing the development experience. I really prefer working in C#, but I am concerned about the size of my application and the runtime. This is a very trivial app and it is 15.66 MB in the emulator plus the 25.87 MB for the Monodroid runtime. That is compared to the same app written in Java at 24 KB.
 
This seems excessive for a mobile device. The largest app currently on my phone is only 9 MB and most are less than 1. Is this because they are debug binaries? If so, what size will the release version of the runtime be?
 
What will the app store experience for the user be? Will the runtime come down with my app, or will it need to be pre-installed?
 
I am asking because I really like the idea of developing in C# and sharing code between different mobile operating systems and possibly even with a website, but the size seems to make monodroid a non-starter for me.
 
What are other peoples thoughts on this? Am I missing something?
 
Thanks
 
Rob Prouse
