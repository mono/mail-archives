your problem does sound familiar.  I've seen that behavior.  I haven't seen it over the past week, and I have been hitting the last preview pretty heavily.

Yeah I am on the latest preview, and yeah I definitely like debugging on my device better but sometimes the girlfriend wants to use her phone :(  ( I'll get a Droid once my contract is up )

So when I debug on the device all is good and fast.  But when I use the Emulator, even from a clean VS session, I have to close and restart it a second time for it to be found.  Not a big deal I guess, could be just me, but if it were happening to everyone it may be worth noting.

This sounds familiar.  Apologies for the stupidity of the question, but are you on the latest preview?  I have found that if you start the emulator from a clean visual studio session, everything does seem to work properly.  Personally, I'm moving to debugging on my device.  its faster and seems less error prone now that the debugging issues I have seen are resolved.  If you go that route, you'll need to turn on wifi on your device and hook it to a valid network.  Don't know why, its just something that jonp told me.

Is anyone else experiencing the following?

The first time I Start up a new instance of the Emulator from Visual Studio, it can't be found as a valid debugging device.  I have to close it down, then restart it before it is found.  Seems like this only showed after the latest preview release...  Is it just me?

Thanks,

Dan
