<PRE>I am just getting started looking at Monodroid. To compare, I wrote a simple
ToDo app in both Java and C# and have been comparing the development
experience. I really prefer working in C#, but I am concerned about the size
of my application and the runtime. This is a very trivial app and it is
15.66 MB in the emulator plus the 25.87 MB for the Monodroid runtime. That
is compared to the same app written in Java at 24 KB.

 

This seems excessive for a mobile device. The largest app currently on my
phone is only 9 MB and most are less than 1. Is this because they are debug
binaries? If so, what size will the release version of the runtime be?

 

What will the app store experience for the user be? Will the runtime come
down with my app, or will it need to be pre-installed?

 

I am asking because I really like the idea of developing in C# and sharing
code between different mobile operating systems and possibly even with a
website, but the size seems to make monodroid a non-starter for me.

 

What are other peoples thoughts on this? Am I missing something?

 

Thanks
