This sounds familiar.  Apologies for the stupidity of the question, but are you on the latest preview?  I have found that if you start the emulator from a clean visual studio session, everything does seem to work properly.  Personally, I'm moving to debugging on my device.  its faster and seems less error prone now that the debugging issues I have seen are resolved.  If you go that route, you'll need to turn on wifi on your device and hook it to a valid network.  Don't know why, its just something that jonp told me.

Is anyone else experiencing the following?

The first time I Start up a new instance of the Emulator from Visual Studio, it can't be found as a valid debugging device.  I have to close it down, then restart it before it is found.  Seems like this only showed after the latest preview release...  Is it just me?

Thanks,

Dan
