<PRE>I think one important thing for all MonoDroid Developers to consider is
whether or not their apps will be installable to SD.

While many newer Android Devices have more internal storage, most of the old
ones do not. I for one have a Nexus One with precious little Internal
Storage so that remains high on my list of things to think about when
installing Apps and typically I find myself removing large apps that only
install to Internal Storage to make room for others.

There are guidelines for what can and what can not be installed to SD so
keep that in mind when writing your apps.

You can review those guidelines here:

You may need to think about this in terms of your development language
choice or just how you deploy your app. If your application will require
10MB plus to install and can only install on Internal Storage you are going
to get a ton of complaints in the Market and will likely miss out on sales.

A good tip though is to provide addon Apps for those features that should
NOT be installed to SD such as Widgets.

I see a lot of really great Apps that can not be moved to SD simply because
they provide Widgets and you are not &quot;supposed&quot; to move Apps with Widgets to
SD because they will be unavailable if the SD Card is removed or mounted for
USB access. Case in point, the official Twitter App is over 8MB and can't be
moved to SD due to its Widgets. I personally have held my trigger finger
over the install for that app several times as my Internal Storage spaces is
precious.

In cases like this, if your app will indeed be large but makes use of
Widgets or any feature not recommended for movement to SD I would highly
recommend breaking up your app into addons so that the main app can be moved
to SD and then provide addon apps that are much lighter for Internal
Storage.

Just something to think about.
