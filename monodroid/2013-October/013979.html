The version on the component store is a hack. (And I say that having helped design it in the first place...)

Embedding the .jar into the assembly is BY FAR the better way to go, because of versioning.

For example, assume [0] that you have a Google Play Services r10 binding. (_Just_ the binding, not the corresponding .jar!) Further assume that &quot;somehow&quot; the system .jar was updated to Google Play Services r12. Further assume that r12 added a _new_ abstract method on a class also present in the r10 binding, and (finally) assume that you're attempting to subclass that type with the added abstract method.

Boom, you have a javac error at ACW generation time: <A HREF="http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/6881/mapsandlocationdemo-v3-google-play-services-build-error">http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/6881/mapsandlocationdemo-v3-google-play-services-build-error</A>

This, plainly, sucks.

So why did we do it? Because the Google Play Services license prevents us from embedding the .jar into the binding assembly and shipping the resulting assembly. (At least by our reading of the license.)

We have plans to make this process more resilient, but it's _still_ a hack. Embedding the .jar into the assembly is a FAR better solution if you're able to do so.

&gt;<i> How do I make my bindings pull the jar file from the installed android sdk directory at compile time like the GooglePlayServices library on the component store?
</I>
If you _really_ want to do this [1], you would do this via the added-in-4.8.1 (and currently undocumented) Android.IncludeAndroidResourcesFromAttribute and Java.Interop.JavaLibraryReferenceAttribute custom attributes. These are assembly-level attributes:

	[assembly: Android.IncludeAndroidResourcesFrom (@&quot;Path\To\res\directory&quot;)]
	[assembly: Java.Interop.JavaLibraryReference (@&quot;Path\To\Library.jar&quot;)]

Again, I do not recommend using these attributes. Embedding the .jar and resources into the binding assembly makes for a FAR saner and less painful experience.

[0]: This has in fact already happened.
[1]: Note: you don't want to do this.
