<PRE>Hi,

Following the release of my Time Of Death app (which has had &gt;1500
downloads and isn't even on the Market), my boss has given me free reign
over my next forensic science Android app.

I already have the basis of one as a winform app - it is a speed of
collision/skid length analysis application. For Android though I want to
extend it into the application the skid analysis one was supposed to be.
Problem is that I don't know if Mono for Android can handle what I want
to do.

What I'm looking to do is use the code I have for stopping distance,
grip efficiency and the likes but to tie that into a screen that allows
a model to be built (add roads, junctions, roundabouts, lighting,
corners - think Lego and you get the idea), draw in the skid marks and
final positions of the vehicles (again, these are from a choice). Based
on that, do the calcs. For the final positions and fine detail, the
software must be able to zoom into created image using a two finger
gesture.

I've not seen anything like this on Android (in or out of Mono for
Android) and have certainly not seen any form of drag and drop or
line/curve drawing examples anywhere.

Is what I'm trying to do going to work using Mono for Android for a
start?

Comments welcome

Paul
