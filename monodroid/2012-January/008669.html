<PRE>Hi

Few years ago I tried to reuse code (Domain, Business logic) from 
Silverlight on &quot;binary&quot;
level in WPF and that was doable, but just not feasible.
That's the reason I prefer and we argued a lot, but came to conclusion 
that sharing code
is better.

 1. Sharing code with Project Linker
     1. hack if necessary in csproject file for extra extensions M4A.cs,
        MTch.cs
        normally Project Linker is used for WPF/Silverlight targeting
        projects
     2. process
         1. determine smalles subset usually WP7
            WP7 has smaller subset of features
            example all methods are Async while MTch and M4A allow sync
            (WebClient)
         2. link other projects (MTch and M4A) to WP7
         3. each new cs file added to WP7 proj shows in other projects
            ability to add multiple src files.
            Files with *.Silverlight.cs extension will not be linked
            into other projs.
         4. classes should be partial so if there is platform diff add
            deltas like:
             1. Class.Silverlight.cs to WP7 project
             2. Class.MTch.cs to MTch project
             3. Class.M4A.cs to M4A project
         5. If needed some stuff can be manually added as link with
            copy-as-link/paste
            VSCommands, Power Commands or Productivity Tools (not sure)
         6. If project linker does not pickup some links, just go to
            source project (WP7)
            do exclude/include and voila everything comes as link in
            linked projects.
         7. all above works in MonoDev so when needed to switch there
            shouldn't be any
            problems
 2. heavy use of partial classes
    common stuff in Class.cs this is propagated by Project Linker
    through other linked
    projects (except extensions - hack from 1.1)
 3. team consent and discipline - naming
    all controls same names across projects.
    We had to make table with what is called what and where.
    Sample:
    we call all labelName if that is the purpose of Control/Widget
    (short text)
    WinForms - Label
    WPF - TextBlock
    SL - TextBlock
    SLWP - TextBlock
    MTch - UITextView
    M4A - TextView
 4. For more VS centric devs small shell script to add/remove MonoTouch
    ProjectType GUID
    for easier loading into VS (dos batch using sed.exe and bash on MacOSX)

Other things would be that

  * code can be linked into desktop projects and as we know unit testing
    for desktop
    projects is still ahead of WP7 test projects or MTch and M4A.
    And the question is whether we need UnitTests for each platform
    (we do only if there are diffs)
      o unit test for  mobile still involve emulators/simulators, so
        testing with nUnit is faster
  * source is really compiled for each platform, so some problems might
    show up earlier than
    when just tossing assembly as reference into project.
