<PRE>Thank you very much.

Maybe I should explain my situation: I bought a MonoTouch + MonoDroid
enterprise licence almost a year ago, when it was still with Novell. We
already have two applications developed in C# for .NET 2.0 for Windows
Desktop and also for the .NET Compact Framework for those good old no longer
built Windows Mobile devices. One of the applications is about 250K lines of
code of which we share about 150K lines between .NET for Windows, .NET
Compact Framework, MonoTouch and Mono for Android. Right now my colleague
who is responsible for iPhone development is making good progress using
MonoTouch and the port is almost complete. Which is great. With Mono for
Android things look not at all that good and we have often been at the verge
of giving it up completely. Due to the many (now fixed) GC bugs it was
almost impossible to use the partly ported Android app for more than a short
while without crashing. Also the Debugger was unusably slow, if it worked at
all. These problems were probably due to the large (?) scale of the project
including background threads, Internet access and so on. I really hope that
Mono for Android will soon come to the point of sophistication where
MonoTouch already is and which enables us to actually create a releaseable
product. Thank you for making this possible!
