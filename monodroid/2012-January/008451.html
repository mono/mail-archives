Chris,

Thanks.  This is really good information.  it just reinforces to me the finicky-ness of adb.

I&#8217;m not sure what was going on, but I believe that what fixed the problem was killing adb.exe.
 
I found that I was able deploy if I opened the project file for the android application directly instead of opening the solution file, which made me think it might be something wrong with the solution file, but
 I didn&#8217;t see anything there that would cause this.  I ended up noticing that I had file locks by some process and found that it was adb.  Killing it and reopening the solution made it deployable again.  It appears that this was some kind of caching issue?
 
Oh, well.  It&#8217;s working now.
 
Thank you,

Subject: VS not recognizing manifest for my application after code restructuring


 
I just did a significant restructuring of our codebase, and Visual Studio is now not recognizing our android application project as a deployable project.  It is also not recognizing the AndroidManifest.xml file when I go to the project
 property pages, and when I click the &#8220;Click to add one&#8221; link, it crashes Visual Studio.
 
I checked the project file, and it is still marked as
&lt;AndroidApplication&gt;true&lt;/AndroidApplication&gt;.
 
I did a compare with the previous version, and the only thing I changed in the project file that I&#8217;m seeing might be related is that I modified the RootNamespace and AssemblyName.  I tried modifying the AndroidManifest.xml file to set the
 PackageName to the same value as the AssemblyName (they were in sync prior to my restructuring) just in case that was the problem, but it didn&#8217;t appear to have any effect.
 
How does Visual Studio determine if a project is deployable?  (I know it has to have the AndroidApplication set to true, but there is obviously something else preventing deploy at present)
 
Thank you for your help.
