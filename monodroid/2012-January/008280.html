<PRE>I have 2 workstations.  Both were working fine yesterday.  At some point last
night, I got an error on my primary machine where it said something like
&quot;unable to build package&quot;. 

So I did a rebuild all and everything seemed fine, but I really didn't
deploy and test anything.

This morning, when I began working, I noticed that my breakpoints were not
being triggered.  The code seemed to merrily bypass them and keep running. 
I put a breakpoint on the first line in OnCreate and it never stops.  The
application just boots and starts running.

I tried the same code on my laptop, and it worked fine. It Hit the
breakpoint and allowed me to step.

I tried on the emulator instead of my target device and it still failed to
stop at the breakpoint on the main workstation.

I rebooted the PC, the device, the emulator... no joy.
I uninstalled mono, and the android SDK, deleted the xamarin registry group,
and re-installed.  no joy.

I tried it on a native window application and it works perfectly.  But not
on an android device/emulator.

*My primary workstation no longer stops at breakpoints but my laptop, works
fine.

HEELPPP!!!!
