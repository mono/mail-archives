<PRE>Thanks Jon and Tsukrov

Jon I tried your example first (and I want to learn it) but it is slow going
and maybe I'm out of league here :-)
I am make slow progress though. Ultimately it is your example I want to come
to grips with. I appreciate that you may not have time to do this (or see
the relevance) but if you can post a full code example that works I would be
extremely happy  :-)

That way I can really study and learn it for when I come to other Java
libraries in the future. I looked at the code example links you gave me and
admittedly I am struggling.

Tsukrov, I tried your code and it works nicely  :-)  I'm doing testing on my
publisher account and I am getting errors when testing against LICENSED and
NOT_LICENSED but I think that is more Google not supplying the VT, GT and GR
codes.

I want to thank you both for helping me here. It really has helped me a lot!
