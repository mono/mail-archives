<PRE>Nikoli,

You should be fine with Mono for Android, the main things you'll need to
watch out for are &quot;the Android way of doing things&quot; as opposed to the
&quot;Windows Forms way of doing things&quot;. That would apply if you were using Java
and Eclipse, you'd still need to learn about the different terminology and
paradigms that Android has in comparison to Windows.

Mono for Android gives you access to the core Android SDK classes, things
like View (read &quot;Control&quot; ish) and Activity (read &quot;Form&quot; ish) in C# to the
same extent that you'd be using them from Java.

In terms of signature capture, in the Windows world you're probably using
things like a Control's OnMouseDown override, along with MouseEventArgs.

With Mono for Android you don't have exactly the same methods or event args,
but you have Android.Views.MotionEvent available within a View's
OnTouchEvent and you can test for MotionEventActions.Down/Up/etc.

You'll need to re-work some code but the bulk of it should carry over
between the platforms.

At various times over the last year or so it's been pretty painful as Mono
for Android has matured, but you're lucky that's it now a stable and very
powerful platform - I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for cross platform
C# development.

Cheers,

Andy

Subject: [mono-android] Signature Capture

I was wondering if any one had any insight on signature capture using
monodroid. I am in the evaluation process and monodroid looks like it would
be extremely helpful in porting our application to Android. I have an
existing windows forms application that asks a few questions, prompts for a
signature and uploads the answers to a website using a web service. A quick
look at the documentation seems make all of this possible except for the
signature. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks,
~Nick
