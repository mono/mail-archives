Good question. I have no good answer; it wasn't implemented until Nov 24 2011:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/a04edc9de8a2bacf30ddfc5b486b8221cf506583">https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/a04edc9de8a2bacf30ddfc5b486b8221cf506583</A>

We'll be merging this patch into the Mono for Android branch; it _should_ hit the next release.

Doubly odd is that &quot;not implemented&quot; members _should_ have [MonoTODO], but that wasn't visible either.

&gt;<i> More importantly, why is there no warning? This isn't an interface method so it shouldn't even be exposed if it isn't implemented.
</I>
There are some exceptions to this, but in general I would agree with you. Historically there's been a lot of variation over what's done with unimplemented members; usually at minimum they get [MonoTODO], but even that was skipped here.

&gt;<i> Or at the very least it should be flagged by the compiler so we know not to use it.
</I>
The only way to flag such things with the compiler is via Obsolete, which wouldn't be appropriate. I suppose we could hack the C# compiler...but that would only help those building with mcs, which is _not_ the case for those using Windows.
