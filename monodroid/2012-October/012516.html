<PRE>so I am thinking of starting my mobile programming with mono for droid....

anyway most of the ideas i have involve using the touchscreen in ways I have
not seen before so I am afraid there may be some hardware limitations to
what I want to do.

so here goes....

basically when I use a desktop computer... I can send multiple types of
input simultaneously (or what seems like simultaneously) . for instance I
can scroll to the right and down at the same time by holding down my arrow
keys left and right. Holding down the right arrow key doesn't suddenly
&quot;block&quot; input from the other arrow keys.

However I noticed that on touchscreen phones when I use the touchscreen...
while Im using it other touches get blocked.   This may be because it was
intended... or may be because the app programmers are using precoded
gestures instead of programming their own thing from scratch. 

Let me give a few examples:

In the unblock parked car game... you move a car by touching it and holding
it down. But while you are touching the car you can't move another car (the
input is blocked) . Of course there wouldn't be any point to moving more
than one car at once... but what if you wanted to?

Another example:

Suppose I am in a drawing app. If I start drawing with my finger... I can't
draw with another finger as well at the same time. the input on the
touchscreen everywhere else but where I am initially touching is bloced.
Once again maybe it's because the programmer didn't care to do otherwise.

So now let me give an example of what I *want* to do.

Say I have a drawing program. I want to create a virtual button on a corner
of the screen that when it is held down..... touching with your finger will
erase instead of draw.  

now you may be wondering why I'm asking bout multicore cpus... I was just
curious.. would having the input on different threads somehow be beneficial
? So that as you are holding down the button the rest of the touch screen
isn't locked? Or is that how input in general already works?

edit: Okay I just found a game that has the input still &quot;open&quot; and it proves
that what I want to do is possible. In the game  &quot;Pool master pro&quot; you can
move the cue stick around... and you can also (while holdin the cue stick)
move the power meter which essentially starts to pull the cue stick back. 
Can someone tell me what he did to make the input stay open like that?
