</I>True. I have similar issues (not that many).

</I>I'd say You have right to complain, if not obligation, but I see 
constant improvement.
OK sometimes it bothers me that it is not fast as I would like to see, 
but it is getting better
and better.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize I'm a n00b and have to go through the learning curve

&gt;<i> - but I've
</I>&gt;<i> gone PC to mobile client before many eons ago, and the process from PC to
</I>&gt;<i> PocketPC was in a lot of ways a much better experience. You have a list of
</I>&gt;<i> APis that are supported so you can pick and chose what to use for the PC
</I>&gt;<i> client (lowest common denominator), and whatever API you use that has been
</I>&gt;<i> marked as working on the mobile platform will work. There was some
</I>&gt;<i> funkyness, but the process was essentially smooth. I erroneously assumed it
</I>&gt;<i> would be similar with M4A.
</I>But I think to compare the size of organization behind PocketPC and M4A 
would be unfair.
I can remember I had to write plumbing code for IsolatedStorage between 
WP and RIA
version of Silverlight. That kind of errors happen.

For me there are much worse &quot;strategic&quot; errors that Microsoft does and I 
think Xamarin team
is much better with those decisions. For example: being unable to load 
CE (SmartDevice)
projects into VS2010, because product[s] are not supported anymore is 
hard to justify.
How can CE apps be ported to WP when bare loading is not possible (I do 
not need to
compile and run/debug, just to open it). OK it can be done with altering 
project files, but
this is insane - to cut support for one projects off and not allowing 
those projects to be
ported to new platforms...
I do not want to explain other issues that will (IMHO) hinder WP to gain 
more market share
in coming years...

And I think that our complaints hit faster and more ears at Xamarin than 
at MS.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hoping that M4A will continue to improve so that our experience will get
</I>&gt;<i> smoother over time. The premise of the product is amazing, the execution,
</I>&gt;<i> imho, doesn't fully live up to it, yet. Not to say that Android in itself
</I>&gt;<i> does, either (my list of things that absolutely should change is as long in
</I>&gt;<i> Android 4.1 as it was when I got my first iPhone) - but there's nothing that
</I>&gt;<i> Xamarin can do about limitations of the underlying OS.
</I>Same here. A year ago I was questioning myself whether invested time was 
the right decision.
Today I'm sure it was.

cheers
