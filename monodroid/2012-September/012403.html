<PRE>Hi.

First of all, I must say programming a game is not as simple as it seems.

If you don't have any knowledge about OpenGL and XNA it's going to be
hard beside the tools you use.

Ok, so, first of all you must create an engine with an abstraction
layer to reuse the m&#225;ximum possible code.

If you use monotouch and monodroid, porting your graphic engine
between iOS and Android should be a piece of cake because both
frameworks use the opentk library, nearly 99% of your code will be
compatible, but if you use native languages no code will be
compatible.

And also, opentk is very well documented.

For Windows and WPhone you will use the XNA framework, replicating the
basic functionality of this framework with monotouch and monodroid is
easy if you know opengl, so if you go this way you will have a fully
compatible abstraction layer between your game logic and the graphic
device which will allow to reuse all the logic related to graphics.

If you use native languages nothing of this can be achieved, so you
will need to rewrite the game for each platform.

After the graphic engine you need an audio and input engine, those are
a bit more difficult because each platform has it's own
implementation, but with a bit of effort can be achieved (I have done
it myself and got it working in less than a week)

So, I will recomend monotouch and monodroid if you want to go
multiplatform with the m&#237;nimum code rewriting, and of course, without
the pain of learning a new (well, two, Objective c and Java) language.
I really hate Objective c, it's a completely antinatural language with
horrible constructions if you are used to program in any C variant as
C# , and with Java... the language itself is very similar with some
exceptions (like no events!), but I can asure you the .net framework
is way more usable.

Hope it helps (and hope no Java/Objective c programmers in the list
hate me because this post XD)
