<PRE>Not sure if previous reply does not seem to have got through 

Yes I am starting activity for result 

Oddly it seems to debug into the 'onactivtyresult' method but at the same
time it rebounds to the Oncreate method of the main activity (and the splash
screen) 

As I say this only seems to occur on the Xperia on 4.04 

 

Thanks for the suggestion anyway 

JM

When you start that activity how are you starting it? For result or normal?
I have this working fine but all mine are startactivityforresult

I've acquired an ICS mobile and started testing on it 

I've got several subordinate activities where there is a cancel button which
use Finish() to end the activity.

On the v404 machine this returns right to the beginning and appears to
restart the app including splash screen (although data entered in fields in
main activity is retained) 

whereas on v2.3 machines this does not happen.

After 'Finish()' one is returned to the calling point in the main activity 

 

I have also tried this behaviour on the emulator - using a v2.2  emulator
all happens as planned

Also surprisingly using a v4.03 emulator everything goesto plan but on my
xperia with v4.04 when finish is called not only the subordinate activity (a
simple form) is killed but also the main app seems to be killed and starts
again with teh splash screen and oncreate method 

 

Indeed this behaviour happens regardless of my Cancel button calling
Finish() it happens on the back button as well from a subordinate Activity

 

Why might v 4.04 behave differently and what can be done to restore the v2.3
behaviour in v4.04
