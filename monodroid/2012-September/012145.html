<PRE>I'm currently in the process of doing in-app billing myself. I translated all
the billing Java code into C#. So far it works well for the static responses
I need to test as Google suggests here:
<A HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html">http://developer.android.com/guide/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html</A>

As such it can handle billing supported, purchases, cancellations, refunds,
item unavailable and restoring transactions.

I'm only focusing on in-app billing with managed products. I.e. NOT
unmanaged products or subscriptions. Although the code is there I haven't
tested that. Also I'm not interested in supporting API 6 and below (anything
below Android 2.0). So it needs testing for those operating systems if you
need to support them.

At the moment I now need to test against an unpublished application with
published managed products (as explained in the above hyperlink). As I do
all this partime outside of my fulltime job it could be another week before
I finish this side of testing.

Unless somebody beats me to it, once I've finished testing I'll be happy
send you the code.

Can we upload code to this forum?
