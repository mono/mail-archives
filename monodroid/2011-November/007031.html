<PRE>Web service is just a URL and we dynamically build them all the time.
Matter of fact we use a random number generator.  For example, we have
20 websites and we us ws_x.hostURL.com.  ws_0 ws_1 ws_2 etc etc  we also
dynamically build the hostURL too.  

Note however, we dropped web services in our android projects because of
the overhead.  We replaced it with a simply post/get.  The network
overhead of directly consuming web services caused network to memory
issues.  When we added all the SOAP it was BLOATed and caused issues on
phones etc which have less bandwidth and memory.  

After messing around with web services we decided the overhead was too
much so we built a webpage that accepts Post/Gets.  Now, we build a
special XML record set that only has elements that are not empty (or not
set to default - no need to pass them).  We then encode it, add SOH +
BLOCK + data +  CRC + ETX (yes the old xmodem data pack) and post it to
the website.  The website makes sure there is a SOH and ETX, calculates
the CRC on data and compares it. Then we process the xml if it passes.
This reduced our overhead by over 80% compared to using web services.
We pass binary data the same way.  Bottom-line we never noticed issues
on computers, but when we went to hand held devices (with slower
bandwidth) the web services was transmitting to much data and causing
memory issues.

Subject: [mono-android] Calling arbitrary web services

We have an application which we want to write some supporting mobile
apps
for.  The idea is that if you buy our app, it comes with a web service,
and
you will host that service on your server, so it has access to your data
store and can be used to provide access to your data.  Therefore the
interface is strongly typed, but the location is unknown.  We're
expecting
to write this with WCF.  All the examples I am seeing, require me to
create
a reference to a service.  I can do that, but I'll need to dynamically
change the location of the service.  Are there any examples along those
lines, or any advice anyone can offer ?
