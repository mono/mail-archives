<PRE>Randy,

I just recently dealt with this issue, but I am not able to reproduce it.  I have the following example working:

    [Activity(Label = &quot;TestApp&quot;, MainLauncher = true, Icon = &quot;@drawable/icon&quot;)]
    public class Activity1 : Activity
    {

        protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
        {
            base.OnCreate(bundle);

            // Set our view from the &quot;main&quot; layout resource
            SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main);

            // Get our button from the layout resource,
            // and attach an event to it
            Button button = FindViewById&lt;Button&gt;(Resource.Id.MyButton);

            button.Click += delegate
            {
                this.StartActivity(typeof(Activity2));
            };
        }
    }

    [Activity(Label = &quot;Activity2&quot;)]
    public class Activity2 : Activity
    {
        protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)
        {
            base.OnCreate(bundle);

            // Set our view from the &quot;main&quot; layout resource
            SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main2);
        }
    }

Thank you,

Chris Tossing

P.S.  If you don't want the first activity to be in the &quot;Back&quot; history at all, you need to set NoHistory=true in the [Activity(...)] attribute.

Subject: [mono-android] Resuming app always reverts to first activity

I ran a simple test:


1.       Create a fresh Mono for Android project.  Add a second activity, and make the button of the default activity launch the second activity.

2.       Make an identical app in Eclipse using pure Java.

3.       Launch the Java app, tap the button to go to the second activity.  Now press Home, then re-launch the app.  Note that the app comes up on the second activity.

4.       Launch the Mono for Android app, tap the button to go to the second activity.  Now press Home, then re-launch the app.  The app comes up on the first activity.

This surprised me.  Why is there a difference?  And more importantly, how can Mono for Android apps resume where they left off like Java apps do?

Searching has turned up this question on StackOverflow&lt;<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6114480/how-to-resume-android-app-where-it-was-suspended-app-not-activity">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6114480/how-to-resume-android-app-where-it-was-suspended-app-not-activity</A>&gt; and I also found it asked a while ago on this alias, but neither has an answer to these questions.

Thanks!
