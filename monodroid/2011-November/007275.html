<PRE>
I'm here.  I read the list every day, multiple times per day.
I think that there needs to be some thought about what the emailing lists and Xamarin:It is a holiday weekend in the US.This is a mailing list.  Its for community type of support and discussion.  Community support is just that, community support and discussions.  There are no guarantees of anything.  I've posted questions on here and not gotten a response.  Yeah, it stinks, but that is what happens, and not just in here.I look for answers as well.  The feeling I get is that there isn't enough marketshare for the m4a product at this time.  As marketshare increases, there will be more people and it will be more valuable.  It needs to reach critical mass.Issues with the Android SDK aren't Xamarin issues, they are google issues.  I have a ton of issues with the Android SDK.There are a ton of problems in Android.  When I was at AnDevCon, I watched how everyone had issues with the Android SDK.  When the last sdk came out, one of my friends immediately called me and asked what problems I had with it before I knew it was out.  Google seems to be getting worse regarding the SDK, not better.Xamarin is not Microsoft. They just don't have the resources.  It stinks, but I'd like the Xamarin devs to work on the product.Xamarin understands that there are issues.  I don't speak for them. I know that they have tough decisions to make.  Where do you put your limited resources to make the bet use of them?  Its a hard question to answer.
Yeah, I know how it is. When we pay for a product, we all want everything to work perfect.  I'm not trying to be argumentative, merely share some issues that I have run across in the past in other forums.
