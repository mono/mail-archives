No. The .apk file is a ZIP package that can contain native shared libraries, and libmonodroid.so is a native shared library. Just because it's a .apk does not mean it's cross platform (just as being Java does not make it cross-platform; see also `native` methods and the fact that `android.jar` doesn't run elsewhere yet ;-)

&gt;<i> 	&#8226; Does m4a support x86 android? I was under the impression it did not at this time.

Not at this time.

&gt;<i> 	&#8226; Do the Xamarin guys think that they can/will support x86 android in the future?
</I>
Maybe. :-)

It's being looked into. I can't promise anything at this point in time.

&gt;<i> 	&#8226; isn't google tv x86?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> 	&#8226; Any thoughts regard the x86 marketplace for android, besides the fact it barely exists?

I'm sure it'll be there eventually, it's just not there yet.

As for Xamarin priorities, getting 2.0 out the door with support for Android v4.0 is our highest priority. After 2.0 is out, lots of things are under investigation.
