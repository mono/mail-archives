<PRE>If you have a good amount of startup code which construsts various objects, then I would recommend the use of an IoC container to introduce lazy loading of those objects. I am using Funq, an open source library. It is highly optimized and fairly easy to understand, as it doesn't use reflection to hook things up - you simply define a lambda expression which returns an instance of the class being requested. It supports all use cases I have needed and allows me to not have my objects get created until they are needed by the application the first time. There is a good series of screencasts which show how it was developed from start the finish using test-driven development (TDD) which is well worth watching.

Another thing to keep in mind is that if you haven't tested on an actual device, you may be very surprised how much faster the device is. I was blown away at the difference - it was like night and day.

Thank you,

Chris
