<PRE>I just wanted to mention that ever since upgrading to 1.9.2 from 1.2, I seem to have had issues where a running emulator will not show up in the list of deployable devices, and I will have to start the same emulator image that is already running in order to deploy.  I assumed that it was just a bug that would work itself out before 2.0 release, but I realized that, unless I say something, it may not be.

Also, unlike Wally, I have not had another device connected to my computer, and I have been using the trial version.  (I just purchased last night)  I want to be clear that I did not observe this behavior until upgrading to 1.9.2.  (although I have only really begun serious development using Mono for Android just recently)

Thank you,

Subject: Re: [mono-android] running emulator VDs

I've been digging more into this problem more over the past couple of days.  It seems to only occur when my physical device (htc evo 4g) is connected to my computer running sdk r15.  This doesn't happen to my computer that is still running r14 and doesn't seem to happen when my device is not connected.  I dug into this, and the r15 version of adb seems to not like my evo.  Previously, the r14 and earlier versions liked my hardware device more, but still had issues.

As an fyi, the r15 version of adb likes my xoom just fine.  I'll probably be testing there more.
