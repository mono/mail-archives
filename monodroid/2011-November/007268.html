<PRE>Hi all,

Is there any way to test the performance of Monodroid on a real device
BEFORE paying for a full licence?

The thought of using c# is very appealing but as an indie developer the
thought of risking $400 on something that isn't performant on a real device
is too high. I know you can test on an emulator but thats really not
practical if building games etc.

I see a lot of similar comments in other forums from people being turned off
MonoDroid because of the cost.  It seems to me that many more developers
would be willing to buy a licence if they could see for themselves how it
runs on a real device. Assurances from other developers is not enough!

Most other Android SDKs offer this - even if its a time limited trial.  The
Corona SDK is even better and allows unlimited testing on a real device but
you just need to buy a licence before publishing a commercial app.

Do Xamarin have any plans to offer something like this?
