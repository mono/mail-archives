Without looking up those specific libraries...

Support for _easily_ using Android/Java libraries from C# code is a post 1.0 feature (i.e. what Mono.Android.dll does for android.jar).  We will support it, but after 1.0.

As a workaround, we are ~directly exposing the JNI functions, so you could use those to create instances of unbound types and invoke methods on them, but JNI by itself won't allow overriding virtual methods or implementing interfaces -- those require monodroid.exe support, and monodroid.exe requires assemblies.  (I suppose we could public some guide for manually creating bindings based on the existing infrastructure, as [Register] + JNIEnv are most of what's necessary, but it would likely be a lesson in pain, suffering, and why we're not hand-writing these bindings.)

For managed (C#) libraries, you will likely need to recompile them against the MonoDroid profile, as the MonoDroid profile differs from the normal/desktop profile.  Assemblies built against MonoTouch should work unchanged (except for some OpenTK bits).

Native libraries can be used via [DllImport] as normal, but Android isn't a normal Linux distro (many libraries are in different locations), and we're not currently supporting .dll.config files for native library renaming, so you may need to use [DllImport(&quot;/full/path/to/library.so&quot;)] for native libraries not distributed with your application.

&gt;<i> How does this work with monoTouch (iAd)?
</I>
Not at all.  iAd is specific to iOS, and thus is specific to MonoTouch.
