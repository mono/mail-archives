<PRE>
Byron,

Here are few thoughts.

Performance.  I find performance a hard thing to measure.  For example, I originally started programming C on Unix 20+ years ago.  My career path took me VB on Windows, and then to .NET.  Not once was I asked about performance by a customer when the sucject of frameworks came up.  typically, in a line of business app, performance is a db issue.  Now, with a mobile app, performance has a bunch of various potential  bottlenecks.  1 ghz ARM processors with 512 megs of ram can be limiting.  3g networks are not that fast.  Having said all of that, there are still the .NET issues.  It takes time for an app to spin up.  How much?  Unfortunately, the linked is not done so we just don't know.  We won't know about memory utilization, working sets, or any of that cool stuff at this point in time.

There is a size overhead with the currently planned embedded runtime.  With that size, you get the .NET framework.  You don't have to go learn the framework built into Android.  You get to use the .NET framework you already know.  You don't have to go learn Eclipse, you get to continue to use Visual Studio, which contains a large ecosystem that makes your life easier. Its not that eclipse or java as implemented in Android has anything wrong, heck its a very good toolset.  Its just that can take time to come upto speed  on java/dalvik and Eclipse.  Eventually, we'll get a separate runtime published by Novell so the size will go down for the individual apps.   (Sorry if that wasn't suppossed to be public guys)

On a programming, you have to be efficient with what you do. Remember, its not a desktop system, don't create a ton of objects.  Be efficient with what you have.  You have really limited resources, cpu, memory, screen.

as for database choices, depending on remote databases will mean that your app is continually hitting the 3g/wifi antennas.  That will hit the battery.  I can drain a battery on my iphone faster than you can imagine because I hit the antennas too much.  I think I have this fixed enough be &quot;caching&quot; data in sqlite and only hitting the web services when I need to

On the performance front, I would always expect Mono to be slower than .NET on the same operation in the same situation and hardware.  I don't use the desktop/server versions of Mono, so I can't compare Mono and .NET on the same hardware.  Novell has limited resources in comparison to Microsoft, so I don't expect them to be able to catch them with regards to performance.  I know that Novell is working on changes to the base Mono framework to narrow the performance gap, specifically in the area the gc.  I don't know how that will translate to MonoTouch and MonoDroid.

Hopefully, a few of these random thoughts (some can call it drivel) are helpful.  As for the resources, check out our MonoTouch book that shipped back in July. Bryan Costanich has once coming out shortly.  Mike Bluestein has one coming out as well.  MonoDroid is much further behind with regard to learning resources.  I have an article coming out on it, not sure when it will be published. Its a beginner article, so probably not for this group.

Oh Byron,

One more thing is if you are a professional .Net developer then Monodroid is the obvious choice as you would already be familiar with the stack and working with importing library's.

In effect I prefer working with Monodroid to the Eclipse environment on anything overtly complex. The small overhead of the runtime gives far more flexibility in coding than plain Java based development imho.


Best,

Glen

Hi Byron,

I've been asked this question before and there are many pages on the subjects including Wikipedia.

Regarding the database I would look into SQL Lite which is the default database for Android and although text based is very fast due to the engine being generated around in memory architecture, or hash tables and dynamic loading to memory for caching and performance.




The biggest issue with Monodroid that I'm aware of is the embedded run-time within your package, which does carry an overhead. The other being that it is still in development and moving at an alarmingly fast rate, there are still some aspects that have not fully been covered.




I wish you every success in making the right choice, I personally have used Monodroid and keep a watch on the ximian mail list but have found that the Native Android SDK with the Eclipse environment has been adequate for my purposes.

    Hello,

    

    I am doing a presentation for a local .NET User Group, Florida .NET
    in Miramar, FL at DeVry University on MonoDroid and how it can be
    used to make it easier to port applications made in .NET, WP7 and
    other Mono Projects to Android.  I have been getting a few questions
    from people who cannot attend the event, but want to know some
    information about it via e-mail.  I am not sure about the answer to
    all of these questions, but I wonder if anyone here would know.

    

    Here are some questions I received that I am not sure about:

    

         
        &#183;         How is
    the performance? Is it on the par with Java and Objective-C?
    &#183;         I suspect the
      executable is larger do to Mono. What are the issues in having the
      extra Mono baggage?
    &#183;        My initial plan is to
      use a Web Service/Json Base service for accessing the data from my
      SaaS application. I would eventually want to move to an on device
      DB. Is this a sound approach or  should I go directly to an on
      device DB?

        
    &#183;   What

      educational resources do you recommend for learning Mono for the
      Droid/iPhone?
