<PRE> Kevin,

We're talking about three bullet points with the loose text, right? To
insinuate that people are &quot;[deliberately] attempting to find loopholes&quot;
is pretty ridiculous. Reading the &quot;NDA bullet points&quot;, it's obvious
general communication is not forbidden.

If Novell meant otherwise, I'm sure they'll officially communicate it to
the group.

</I>&gt;<i> I understand the desire to talk about MonoDroid at User Group

</I>&gt;<i> Miguel and Joseph, I think you really need to address this and make it

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I think showing MonoTouch and Windows Phone 7 development
</I>&gt;<i> and discussing the possibilities of sharing code between projects to
</I>&gt;<i> develop for iPhone and WP7 is a great idea and mentioning that
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDroid is coming and will allow such code sharing as well would be
</I>&gt;<i> great for a UG meeting but as Miguel pointed out, I think the typical
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft stack Developers will just go to town making fun and point
</I>&gt;<i> out inadequacies if they see MonoDroid in such an early stage,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if there are any hiccups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hate to sound like a sourpuss, I'm just trying bring everyone down
</I>&gt;<i> to Earth and hopefully to get the MonoDroid Team to address this
</I>&gt;<i> question once and for all.
