<PRE>Rafael and others, I do apologize if my message ruffled some feathers but
the facts are there. After the question was raised of &quot;how much can we
show&quot;, the pertinent parts of the NDA were copy/pasted into the response
thread and Miguel even chimed in to make sure everyone understood why Novell
does not want us talking about MonoDroid publicly at this time yet if you
follow the thread after those points were made, you will find that people
are still asking &quot;but what if&quot; questions.

That's ok, I understand. I think it would be awesome to have a UG meeting
discuss programming for the big 3 mobile platforms using C# and .NET but the
NDA and Miguel have both made their feelings on the subject quite clear.

What led me to send the message I did was that there is another discussion
thread going on where someone has posted an intro to MonoDroid blog article
and based on Tweets, the same person plans a discussion at an upcoming User
Group meeting and even today another person is asking about interest in a
User Group for mobile development including MonoDroid.

In that last case I have talked to that person and they are merely trying to
drum up interest for a future UG and most likely not during the beta but
with all the talk I felt it necessary to try to get a once and for all &quot;this
is what you can and can't do&quot; statement from the MonoDroid team.

While I personally think we already got that, there are still questions
being posted and some who have already read the official responses and are
still trying to get a more clear answer.

Sorry if I came off rude but I, as well as many of us would like to get a
full, crystal clear answer on the subject.

Personally I think it would be acceptable to do a talk at a local UG about
MonoTouch and Windows Phone 7 development and mention that MonoDroid is
coming but I would think it would be unacceptable to fire up Visual Studio
and whip out a demonstration of MonoDroid at this time because as we all
know, stuff don't work as we expect sometimes during early betas like this.
We wouldn't want to give the wrong impression about MonoDroid.

If MonoTouch is any indication of where MonoDroid is going, I think it's
safe to say that we will have a winner on our hands but it is best to follow
Novell's wishes during the beta.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Based on the actual text of the NDA and Miguel's comments thus far it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appears obvious that Novell and the MonoDroid Team would prefer that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beta testers NOT discuss this early beta offering, nor should they do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; talks about it at User Group meetings. This is pretty much standard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for any NDA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, many beta testers are already planning User Group Discussions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around MonoTouch, Windows Phone 7 and now MonoDroid so they are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attempting to find loopholes in the NDA and Miguel's comments to allow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them to do so. Hey, I don't blame them at all, such a UG meeting would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be awesome :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I understand the desire to talk about MonoDroid at User Group
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meetings, especially ones discussing development for iPhone and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Windows Phone 7. I'm not so sure the average Microsoft Developer will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand the implications of MonoTouch and MonoDroid until shown at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an UG meeting, however, I personally think it might look bad for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MonoDroid if during such a presentation during this early beta if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things didn't work as expected.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Miguel and Joseph, I think you really need to address this and make it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clear what is allowed and what is not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Personally I think showing MonoTouch and Windows Phone 7 development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and discussing the possibilities of sharing code between projects to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; develop for iPhone and WP7 is a great idea and mentioning that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MonoDroid is coming and will allow such code sharing as well would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; great for a UG meeting but as Miguel pointed out, I think the typical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Microsoft stack Developers will just go to town making fun and point
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out inadequacies if they see MonoDroid in such an early stage,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially if there are any hiccups.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hate to sound like a sourpuss, I'm just trying bring everyone down
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to Earth and hopefully to get the MonoDroid Team to address this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; question once and for all.
