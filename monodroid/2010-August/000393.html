<PRE>Hello Everyone
Last night, we changed the password on the preview downloads,
as a preview user posted download credentials to Twitter.

You may have noticed that the security mechanism protecting
the preview downloads is pretty simple.  This is primarily because
we would like to keep things easy for us and you.  We don't want
to get overzealous about protecting the download; however, we
would like to try to ensure that preview users have access to the 
mailing list to participate in discussions regarding the program 
(and, in particular, do  not take their feedback somewhere that it 
may be lost).  

Additionally, if we're able to control the influx of users reporting 
new issues, we will have a better chance of addressing most of
your issues in a timely manner.

Here are updated download credentials: 

Username: monodroid-preview
Password: jsuj96Gh

The download is still here:
<A HREF="http://go-mono.com/monodroid-download/">http://go-mono.com/monodroid-download/</A> 

Sorry for the inconvenience.  We would greatly appreciate it if you 
would help us keep the preview program as simple as possible.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Thanks
Joseph

</PRE>
