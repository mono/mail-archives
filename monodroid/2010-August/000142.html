<PRE>
First of all, I have now been able to try and build the first of the tutorial samples, and it worked right out of the box. I already had the Android SDK installed and just had to create an additional AVD (I only had 1.5 and MD seems to require a 1.6 minimum), so I didn't have to go through all this, but it's still nice that it worked quite smoothly. 

This is on Windows Server 2008 Standard x64, VS 2010 Pro.


I have then tried to create and use class libraries in the solution. Referencing a C# library gave me a dialog box with the warning &quot;The Target Framework Version for the project 'xxx' is higher than the current project Target Framework Version. Would you like to add this reference to your project anyway?&quot;. I clicked the dialog away, but the Error List in VS still has a &quot;Warning 2 The project 'xx' cannot be referenced.  The referenced project is targeted to a different framework family (.NETFramework)&quot;.

It doesn't seem to cause problems and I could run it in the emulator, but currently the library hasn't much in it and it might be a problem when there's actual functionaliy.

I don't seem to find a way to change the target framework version in the MD project.


In any case, I also tried a C++/CLI class library, which has all the same problems, and in addition prevents the whole solution from being built. The MD project itself gets the following error after referencing the C++/CLI lib:

&quot;Error 1 while loading assemblies: System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path 'C:\...\visual studio 2010\Projects\MonoDroidApplication1\MonoDroidApplication1\obj\Debug\android\assets'. C:\...\visual studio 2010\Projects\MonoDroidApplication1\MonoDroidApplication1\MONODROID MonoDroidApplication1&quot;


Can't make sense of this. Does it have an easy explanation?


Thanks,
Alexander
