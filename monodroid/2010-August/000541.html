<PRE>Hello,

 

I hate developing apps without testing on a real device.  As I have apps
built with MonoTouch I have an iPhone (active contract with AT&amp;T) and of
course an ancient iPod 2G and iPad.  I'm not overly thrilled with Android as
compared to iPhone but it's something I need to support, and then Windows
Phone 7 coming in Sept (final SDK for devs on Sept 16th).

 

I joined the Android dev program and I see two units sold by a third party,
the Android Dev 2 and Nexus One.  The N1 is $599.  I went by my local
Verizon store and I suppose if I was going to buy one I'd probably lean
towards the new Droid X.  I could buy it outright for the same price (IIRC)
as the N1.  Or go with a contract for $199 + monthly contract fees.  The
dilemma there is I'm hoping for a Verizon iPhone in January.  

 

We're all in this dilemma, i.e. having to figure out how to get Windows
Phone 7 hardware, Android Hardware, iPhone, etc. etc.  How do you all do
this?  Adding lines to an existing contract?  Buying hardware outright as a
&quot;cost of doing business?&quot;  I guess the issue too is spending money on dev
hardware which I have a feeling we'll see with WP7 when it's tempting to get
one that actually is functional as a working phone.

 

Thoughts?  Suggestions?  J  Serious geekhood with 14 phones on my belt at
the bar! J

 

Neal
