<PRE>Hi Miguel,

 

I understand that I have to do some tests myself, which I will. I was
wondering about Reflector protection tricks like messing with the header, or
crashing it at random due to code tampering...

 

Regarding bugs, in addition to what I wrote to Jonathan in my previous
reply, it would be helpful to be able to turn ON and OFF post-builds for
MonoDroid, or at least have separate post-builds for DEBUG and RELEASE. I
have no intention of reporting a bug produced by an obfuscated assembly.

 

It would be great to have some protection over the assemblies! Seeing
Mono.Android.dll and MyApplication.DLL was the first thing that bothered me
as I was examining the APK. While we as Mono/.NET developers know exactly
what it means (drop into Reflector), others do not. At least it would
distract people with a limited knowledge of either Java or .NET. This APK
package is not a standard Android application to begin with, so why not take
an extra step?

 

Thanks,

Amir

Hello Amir,

 

1. Is there an easy way to have an obfuscator handle this file before it's
packed?

2. Do you have an idea if an obfuscated DLL would work on Android? (I will
run some tests myself soon).

3. If possible, allow the DLL to be encrypted or password protected.
Currently it's too easy to fetch.

 

Simple obfuscation will work with MonoDroid, but more advanced obfuscation
that is available on .NET will merely make your application break randomly.
Advanced obfuscators depend on quirks, bugs and special behavior of the .NET
runtime that is not part of the spec, and as such, is incredibly hard to
support.       

 

If you use any of the available .NET tools to obfuscate and report a bug, we
will likely just close the bug without even opening it.   

 

That being said, we have some plans to protect the assemblies, the question
is how important is this to our users.
