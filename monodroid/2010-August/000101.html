<PRE>Hello,

Ok, just found the NDA


The intention of this is to give us a chance to fix bugs and address
problems before MonoDroid goes public.

If folks were to do a public review of MonoDroid based on its current
preview-status, it would not look very good, and it would hurt MonoDroid's
reception based on a product that we knew was incomplete.

In general, we have no problems with developers showing what they are doing,
showing it to co-workers or even blogging about it when you guys are
showcasing the good points.

For the bad parts, we basically want to have a chance to fix the problems
before MonoDroid becomes a public product.    For instance, yesterday thanks
to the discussions on the list we fixed half a dozen problems that were
reported.    We want to keep on fixing those issues, and we would love to
get your bug reports either here or on our bug tracking system.

Once we go public, if we have a bad product, it is fair game to lambast us
in public as much as you want.   But right now, we did not even consider
this a beta, since we are not even feature-complete, this is a preview of
what the product will look like.

Miguel.
