<PRE>Just been playing with the latest MonoDroid.

1. Did New Project, selected OpenGL MonoDroid Application. It builds, but
when I try to debug it I get the following error message...
&quot;An error occurred trying to load the page.
Illegal characters in path.&quot;

There are no spaces in the path and other OpenGL projects, from github,
compile and run fine from the same parent directory.
This error also appears on the Properties/Application tab of the new
project.

Is this an known issue?

2. The TexturedCube demo from github compiles and installs ( 2 instances
strangely enough ), but neither instance run on the emulator.

3. May I suggest you include a couple of simple OpenGL ES 2.0 samples as
well for people to get started with.

4. Can we contribute to the github samples? I think porting something like
Nehe's GridRunner game to both MonoTouch and MonoDroid as examples of
OpenGL games will help newcomers get up to speed quickly. So they have a
simple example that shows how to do text and rendering, and use the
accelerometer, for example, as that is what most newcomers will probably
play with.

5. Another suggestion would be an article or sample, that covers best
practises in writing apps/games that work on both MonoTouch and MonoDroid.

Lastly, the one thing Microsoft do brilliantly with their developer
community is provide tonnes of examples, particularly with their XNA game
stuff.
If possible Novell and those using their tools, should try to create more
simple samples. The quicker someone can work out how to do something by
leveraging a sample, the more productive they will feel and therefore more
likely to sing the praises of that toolset. Just MHO.

Dominique.
