Funnily enough, that's more or less Google's source code convention...

So, we should rename things to avoid clashes...

..but such renamings will make it harder to find out the underlying
Java type.

/me thinks this argument might not be entirely self consistent [0].

Also, one of my planned docs.monodroid.net changes is to have our docs
link to the Android documentation.  It won't be bidirectional, but it
will be ~trivial to determine which Android member a MonoDroid member is
binding.  Perhaps this will help.

&gt;<i> I know, I know, changing it at this point will cause all kinds of

</I>
You have no idea how much we plan on changing things. ;-)

Which is why this is a limited preview: we WILL be changing things, and
don't entirely know what will break as a result.  (For example, we'll be
moving to Mono 2.8 before final release from the current Mono 2.6, and
at some point we'll likely change how monodroid generates Java code[1].)

Furthermore, the &quot;let's prefix interfaces with 'I'&quot; was one of the last
things we did before the first preview.  We could easily revert it.

The question is, and remains, *should* we.  As Michael Cummings said,
MonoDroid is about bringing .NET developers to Android.  As such, our
intent is to make things as consistent for .NET developers as is
practical, e.g. PascalCasing method names, exposing events, and exposing
delegates in addition to *Listener interfaces.

So, given that the .NET convention is to prefix interface names with
'I', and given that docs.monodroid.net will eventually have links into
the corresponding Android documentation, is it &quot;better&quot; to stick with
Java naming or to use naming that's consistent with .NET?

Currently, we think consistency with .NET is preferable.

[0] Then again, &quot;A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of a weak mind.&quot;
Sometimes inconsistency is preferable.

This is arguably a &quot;foolish&quot; consistency angle, and the question becomes
&quot;consistent with what&quot;?  For example, when I wrote the Java proxy
generation code, I felt that since it was Java code, it should be
consistent with Java naming conventions, so OF COURSE the package names
should be camelCased!  That's just obvious, right?  But then we see that
the Java class names are directly usable within e.g. main.xml, so now we
have an inconsistency between the type the C# dev wrote and the type
that monodroid generates, and it's the latter which needs to be used.
