<PRE>You are totally right Wayne and I would say this is another point for
the &quot;usefulness&quot; of Obfuscation J

The only way around people stealing your designs, ideas and innovations
is to constantly stay ahead of the game 

The only things they really can't steal are your passion, persistence,
ideas and innovative approaches. Keep that up and you've won.

Any company founded on stealing ideas, designs and constantly playing
catchup with a  reluctance to innovate will fail.

simples :)

The only &quot;safe way&quot; is possible on systems which allow to bring in
&quot;native code&quot; in the meaning of external DLLs which 

hook deep into the system like &quot;dongle protection&quot; works.

You can &quot;hide&quot; your code by refactoring it to a hard readable thing, and
the result will be hundreds of (meaningless named) classes, 

methods, properties and interfaces a &quot;thief&quot; has to work through.

 

But the real thing that could be stolen is (in most cases) the
application itself.

Why would I steal - I want to have a good (selling) application with
little work.

And what makes a good selling application (excluding marketing)?

The idea (what it does), the design in the form of how things are
organized

and how they look (graphics, animations) and feel (sounds, UI elements).

To hide this you must hide you application - in other words: don't sell
it J

 

I don't know how your projects are done - but in our cases, design (UI
and all the things) is

much more work than coding.

Expect people with (good) programming skills when you talk about
&quot;thieves&quot;. And all they have to know

is how it looks / works. They are for sure able to write their own code
to make a &quot;blueprint&quot; of your app.

Yeah, the logic is still here but it is much harder to read.

However, my bigger point was that 

a) usually we all produce &quot;boring&quot; apps with no rocket science code

b) obfuscation produces debugging/error reporting problems

c) obfuscation might obfuscate too much

d) non obfuscated code might help skilled persons to understand why
something isn't working

e) and as noted, logic is still there

f) problems with code signing

 

I am sure there are other arguments :-)

 

Miha
