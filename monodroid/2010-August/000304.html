<PRE>Miguel and Joseph, this one needs to get nipped in the bud.

Based on the actual text of the NDA and Miguel's comments thus far it
appears obvious that Novell and the MonoDroid Team would prefer that beta
testers NOT discuss this early beta offering, nor should they do talks about
it at User Group meetings. This is pretty much standard for any NDA.

However, many beta testers are already planning User Group Discussions
around MonoTouch, Windows Phone 7 and now MonoDroid so they are attempting
to find loopholes in the NDA and Miguel's comments to allow them to do so.
Hey, I don't blame them at all, such a UG meeting would be awesome :-)

I understand the desire to talk about MonoDroid at User Group meetings,
especially ones discussing development for iPhone and Windows Phone 7. I'm
not so sure the average Microsoft Developer will understand the implications
of MonoTouch and MonoDroid until shown at an UG meeting, however, I
personally think it might look bad for MonoDroid if during such a
presentation during this early beta if things didn't work as expected.

Miguel and Joseph, I think you really need to address this and make it clear
what is allowed and what is not.

Personally I think showing MonoTouch and Windows Phone 7 development and
discussing the possibilities of sharing code between projects to develop for
iPhone and WP7 is a great idea and mentioning that MonoDroid is coming and
will allow such code sharing as well would be great for a UG meeting but as
Miguel pointed out, I think the typical Microsoft stack Developers will just
go to town making fun and point out inadequacies if they see MonoDroid in
such an early stage, especially if there are any hiccups.

I hate to sound like a sourpuss, I'm just trying bring everyone down to
Earth and hopefully to get the MonoDroid Team to address this question once
and for all.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Ok, just found the NDA
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The intention of this is to give us a chance to fix bugs and address
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;problems before MonoDroid goes public.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;If folks were to do a public review of MonoDroid based on its current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;preview-status, it would not look very good, and it would hurt MonoDroid's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;reception based on a product that we knew was incomplete.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;In general, we have no problems with developers showing what they are
</I>&gt;<i> doing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;showing it to co-workers or even blogging about it when you guys are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;showcasing the good points.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;For the bad parts, we basically want to have a chance to fix the problems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;before MonoDroid becomes a public product.    For instance, yesterday
</I>&gt;<i> thanks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;to the discussions on the list we fixed half a dozen problems that were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;reported.    We want to keep on fixing those issues, and we would love to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;get your bug reports either here or on our bug tracking system.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Once we go public, if we have a bad product, it is fair game to lambast us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;in public as much as you want.   But right now, we did not even consider
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;this a beta, since we are not even feature-complete, this is a preview of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;what the product will look like.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Miguel.
