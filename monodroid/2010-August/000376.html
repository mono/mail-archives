<PRE>The JaNETdev project seems to have managed this fairly well, as has IKVM....

Look, I grant you, not all the conflicts will be avoided, but since the point of MonoDroid is to write apps *on Android*, I would think the Android libraries would have first priority.

&gt;<i> Plus, perhaps I'm alone, but I had a visceral &quot;that's weird&quot; feeling whenever I
</I>&gt;<i> did:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         class MyActivity : Activity, View.OnTouchListener {
</I>&gt;<i>                 // ...
</I>&gt;<i>         }
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It just looks very &quot;weird&quot; to me to have multiple &quot;base classes&quot; with no I-
</I>&gt;<i> prefixed types.  It looks...wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yep, it's just you. Why should the developer care about the difference between an interface and a base class? If you know C# or VB, you know that only the left-most class can be anything other than an interface, and if there's ever *really* a question, right-click-Jump-to-Definition tells you for certain (or the compiler/LanguageService lets you know either by flagging an error or red squiggly). In a world where we're writing code inside a text editor, that kind of naming pattern makes sense, but in a statically-typed language.... not so much. 

(Ironic, I know, given that C++ and COM introduced that nomenclature.)

Besides, what do you do when you refactor the interface into an abstract base class or vice versa? Change the name just to reflect the physical structure of the code? Do you prefix all your fields with &quot;f_&quot; or &quot;m_&quot; and your static fields with &quot;s_&quot; and your methods with &quot;mbr&quot; and your buttons with &quot;btn&quot; and your types with &quot;T&quot;?

Given that we're in C#, though, naming clashes can easily be avoided with judicious renaming. You're just making it harder for MonoDroid developers to make the connection to the Java types upon which the platform is based. It's a silly translation to go through for little payoff, IMHO.

I know, I know, changing it at this point will cause all kinds of heartache, create backwards compatibility difficulties, and all the other reasons implementors cite when they're convinced that the random psycho on the mailing list is... well.... a random psycho who couldn't POSSIBLY be right. Cue up your &quot;very good reasons, REALLY&quot; for why you won't do this, and we can bury the thread and suffer on.

</I>&gt;<i> As my original name stated, keeping the original names would NOT avoid

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   - Java.Lang.Object vs. System.Object

</I>&gt;<i>   - Java.Util.ArrayList vs. System.Collections.ArrayList
</I>&gt;<i>   - etc., etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is NO WAY to avoid name conflicts unless we prefix every Java type
</I>&gt;<i> name with some &quot;unique&quot; prefix...which looks ugly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It'll also help avoid weird name-resolution conflicts in peoples'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; heads as they read Java-based Android docs/articles (which I would

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One of my doc projects is to embed links into the Android documentation

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That said, we already know that there will be more fundamental differences

</I>&gt;<i> anonymous inner class support).  We might be willing to undo the I-prefixed
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces, but other things will be unavoidable changes unless you like the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Writing Java in C# but worse!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> development mentality.
