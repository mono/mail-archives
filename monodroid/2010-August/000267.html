Well, actually I think that the failure of Microsoft to make .NET
deployment easy (including having too many dependencies and download
size) did hold the platform back on the Desktop; They've realized this
and have done a better job for .NET 4.

Furthermore, in this case it was reasonable to be concerned, because

- people might have in mind that MonoTouch (which works quite
differently) does really package everything it needs with each app.
- if the runtime is included in each app package 15 MB is quite large,
especially if updates simply replace the whole app (don't know how
this is done on android).
- at least in Germany mobile bandwidth consumption does still matter,
since carriers will throttle bandwidth when a limit is reached.

Still, Geoff pointed out that there _might_ be the option of deploying
apps independent of the runtime and the runtime size will get somewhat
smaller, so it seems to be all right.

Johannes.
