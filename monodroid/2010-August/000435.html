<PRE>This might sound all markety, but please bear with me.

I work for PreEmptive Solutions. We produce Dotfuscator and DashO
obfuscators. I have tested Dotfuscator with MonoDroid and it will fully
obfuscate your assemblies, though it isn't an entirely straightforward
process yet. I would like the opportunity to address the points made here:
a) Nothing I can do about that :)
b) Obfuscation necessarily requires an extra step when viewing stack traces.
Currently an issue with the APK generation prevents you from running your
MonoDroid application in Debug mode, however this does not in any way apply
to non-MonoDroid applications. They can be run with a debugger (if
obfuscated with Dotfuscator) without issue. Dotfuscator regenerates your PDB
file to handle the obfuscated assembly.
c) Dotfuscator gives you insanely precise control over what you want
obfuscated. It defaults to obfuscating everything, and provides mechanisms
for specifying what you do not want obfuscated. We even support Regular
Expression matching to determine what to exclude. We also break the three
major obfuscation mechanisms (renaming, control flow, string encryption)
into separate configuration sections. This means you can have completely
different 'rules' for each technique.
d) This is true, and is the major separation between open source and closed
source applications. We do provide a technology, Runtime Intelligence, that
allows you to gather runtime analytics about your applications in the wild.
We have not yet tested this with MonoDroid but I feel it is a really amazing
technology. Of course, I am biased. That is what I directly work on ;)
e) The logic is still there, but with proper obfuscation you will only be
able to view it as assembly code in Reflector. And best of all, the assembly
code is going to be scrambled. The contextual information around it (fields,
properties, method names) will all be renamed. This will greatly increase
the difficulty in reverse engineering what you are doing.
f) There are absolutely no problems with code signing when using
Dotfuscator. We support strong name resigning, partial signing and
authenticode signing. We support signing of packages (XAP for example). The
only scenario I know of that we do not directly support is resigning strong
named assemblies with a PFX file (password protected). Because we leverage
the .NET SDK you will need to extract the public key into a SNK file, which
is easy.
