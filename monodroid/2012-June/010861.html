<PRE>Have you tried the new x86 Android 4.0 images? It basically lets you
develop Android apps in the same way the iOS simulator does: the apps are
compiled for x86 for the emulator, and deploying would compile them for
ARM. I don't know if Xamarin has already added support for the x86 target
for Android, but if it hasn't, it really should.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I'm doubting I can make an impact but please listen to some feedback from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone who just started out with Mono for Android.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using Visual Studio to develop android applications is really a joy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Deploying on the emulator is another experience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its really unworkable slow and it takes the fun out of using and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experiencing the actual app.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are a lot of misconceptions over using the emulator. Unless you're
</I>&gt;<i> working on a decent processor with a shed load of memory, the emulator is
</I>&gt;<i> slow. There is no way around it - most emulators, irrespective of what they
</I>&gt;<i> do are slower than the actual device; it's the nature of the beast.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once the emulator is up though, it is much quicker. I tend just to keep
</I>&gt;<i> the emulator booted on my dev box. It saves time!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I understand that the evaluation version is designed so that the app
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reach the marker place and be used for a commercial activity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If this is the only constraint that please rethink how it's currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are other ways to prevent commercial deployment by for example
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crippling the app, putting a time limit on the execution, show a message
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> box
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every x seconds,...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of which can be worked around. Face it, this has happened with lots of
</I>&gt;<i> commercial apps and within a day (typically) there is a patch somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> which allows for the nag to be removed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  My scenario is that I want to become productive on android, ios and WP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first have to pass the learning curve. It will take a few months to get a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good product and as a single enthousiast I cannot afford to spend 600 $.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sure this is not the case. The cheapest licence is for education which
</I>&gt;<i> works out to be $99, but a typical one is a bit more than this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Once the app is finished and I am ready to deploy it to the market place I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be ready to buy the licenses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is where the argument falls over. You're expecting Xamarin to work on
</I>&gt;<i> an honour system. Face it, if they said &quot;everyone, it's free for download -
</I>&gt;<i> but you must promise to pay us when you go to market&quot;, I can tell you how
</I>&gt;<i> long they would last in business - probably slightly less than the time it
</I>&gt;<i> will take you to read this email!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Please reconsider this as it will make more developers use it to the point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they have a working app.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, you can get the working app going on the emulator and show
</I>&gt;<i> it around. Enough people like it buy the licence, charge $1 on the
</I>&gt;<i> marketplace and recoup the losses that way. It's the way of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft do the same thing. Buy the product and what you do with it is up
</I>&gt;<i> to you and they have the same restricted system with the Express edition -
</I>&gt;<i> does most of what you want, but not everything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Me, I'll renew my licence in September with pleasure. The Xamarin crew
</I>&gt;<i> have been amazingly helpful and supportive and that alone makes it worth
</I>&gt;<i> the money :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PFJ
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. If anyone wishes to bend what I'm saying or subvert it to their own
</I>&gt;<i> arguments, feel free to - you'll end up looking like a bit of a twit as
</I>&gt;<i> what I've said is here for the world to see rather than elsewhere...
</I>&gt;<i>
