Subject: Re: [mono-android] Consider physical deployment with the evaluation	version

Have you tried the new x86 Android 4.0 images? It basically lets you develop Android apps in the same way the iOS simulator does: the apps are compiled for x86 for the emulator, and deploying would compile them for ARM. I don't know if Xamarin has already added support for the x86 target for Android, but if it hasn't, it really should.

Hi,




I'm doubting I can make an impact but please listen to some feedback from

someone who just started out with Mono for Android.



Using Visual Studio to develop android applications is really a joy.

Deploying on the emulator is another experience.

Its really unworkable slow and it takes the fun out of using and

experiencing the actual app.




There are a lot of misconceptions over using the emulator. Unless you're working on a decent processor with a shed load of memory, the emulator is slow. There is no way around it - most emulators, irrespective of what they do are slower than the actual device; it's the nature of the beast.




Once the emulator is up though, it is much quicker. I tend just to keep the emulator booted on my dev box. It saves time!




I understand that the evaluation version is designed so that the app cannot

reach the marker place and be used for a commercial activity.

If this is the only constraint that please rethink how it's currently done.



There are other ways to prevent commercial deployment by for example

crippling the app, putting a time limit on the execution, show a message box

every x seconds,...




All of which can be worked around. Face it, this has happened with lots of commercial apps and within a day (typically) there is a patch somewhere which allows for the nag to be removed.




My scenario is that I want to become productive on android, ios and WP but I

first have to pass the learning curve. It will take a few months to get a

good product and as a single enthousiast I cannot afford to spend 600 $.




I'm sure this is not the case. The cheapest licence is for education which works out to be $99, but a typical one is a bit more than this.




Once the app is finished and I am ready to deploy it to the market place I

will be ready to buy the licenses.




This is where the argument falls over. You're expecting Xamarin to work on an honour system. Face it, if they said &quot;everyone, it's free for download - but you must promise to pay us when you go to market&quot;, I can tell you how long they would last in business - probably slightly less than the time it will take you to read this email!





Please reconsider this as it will make more developers use it to the point

they have a working app.




To be honest, you can get the working app going on the emulator and show it around. Enough people like it buy the licence, charge $1 on the marketplace and recoup the losses that way. It's the way of it.



Microsoft do the same thing. Buy the product and what you do with it is up to you and they have the same restricted system with the Express edition - does most of what you want, but not everything.



Me, I'll renew my licence in September with pleasure. The Xamarin crew have been amazingly helpful and supportive and that alone makes it worth the money :)

P.S. If anyone wishes to bend what I'm saying or subvert it to their own arguments, feel free to - you'll end up looking like a bit of a twit as what I've said is here for the world to see rather than elsewhere...
