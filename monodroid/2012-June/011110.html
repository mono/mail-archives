<PRE>I wouldn't listen to this guy. HE fired me for grossly over rating my
skills (he said he and 3 other programmers looked over my code. It was a
lie, I disputed them and won.) Also, one of the programmers had the nerve
to come to this list and ask how to use my code. The supposed code that was
misrepresented was just beyond their skill level. I put everything I had
into the project for this guy and he sort of shat on my feelings. Please
ignore him. He's just a talker, no real skill. He has this picture on his
facebook that says gun are the only diversity we need so since I had a name
like &quot;sayed kooshesh&quot; it was no wonder he just completely ignored me the
whole project.

He's wrong. You can use the emulator to test every thing however it's not
PHONE's that are different, it's launchers. Please don't listen to this guy
he's not a pro.

</I>&gt;<i> The biggest thing to consider when developing for Android is that every

</I>&gt;<i> from, iPad 1, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, and iPhone 4S, and
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much all of them can be counted on to be running the same version of
</I>&gt;<i> iOS for the moment.  With Android you don&#8217;t get things this easy.  There
</I>&gt;<i> are versions of OS to consider, Android 2.2, 2.3, 3.0, 3.2, 4.0, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> There are hardware considerations to be made because each android device
</I>&gt;<i> can have different screen pixel density, sizes, etc.  Each can have
</I>&gt;<i> different graphics cards with different abilities.  Each can have vastly
</I>&gt;<i> different amounts of ram, disk space, cameras, no cameras, and other
</I>&gt;<i> hardware differences.****

</I>&gt;<i> This is why most devices on Android have their own &#8220;store&#8221; to weed out
</I>&gt;<i> things that they know won&#8217;t work on it.  We test on nearly 20 phones and
</I>&gt;<i> tablets here just in hopes that we get a good chunk of the market working
</I>&gt;<i> as expected when we release.****

</I>&gt;<i> What you test on really depends a lot on what type of app you are
</I>&gt;<i> developing, and how big of a market you are aiming for.  Best
</I>&gt;<i> recommendations are don&#8217;t try for anything under Android 2.3, and stay away
</I>&gt;<i> from devices that don&#8217;t let you access the Google Play store.  Some
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions to that are of course the Kindle Fire and B&amp;N Nook, both of
</I>&gt;<i> which restrict you to their store, but are heavy players in the market and
</I>&gt;<i> worth building for is you are looking for mass market.****

</I>&gt;<i> If you are looking for cheap, my suggestion is to look for refurb devices,
</I>&gt;<i> for example we often get a variety of test devices from Fry&#8217;s Electronics,
</I>&gt;<i> the electronics supervisor gives us a call when they have some refurbs in
</I>&gt;<i> that we can get for a steal.  This lets us have many devices to test with
