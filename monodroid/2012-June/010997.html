<PRE>Jon,

I tried both of your suggestions but they did not help (I am on Ice Cream
Sandwich with latest mono 4.2.3).

We were disposing the response object at the end already.

&gt;<i>From the logging I can see that the code specifically gets stuck on the read
</I>operation on the stream and throws a 'The operation has timed out. at
System.Net.WebConnectionStream.Read'

I tried another approach of first copying to a memory stream and then get
the bytes from memory stream and write them to the file but we still get
failure on the 'read' operation.

I can see 2 options at this point

a. Create an example and have you guys look into it (that would mean
generating dummy data)

b. Try to do the copying in native java and reference that code via JNI

We know the web service does not have issues because the sync works on
honeycomb and below.

What are your thoughts on option b.?
