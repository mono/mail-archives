By Dispose()ing of them. :-)

Dispose(bool) is called by the GC when the value can be collected. This will be some point after the Activity is closed, but not immediately after, unless you null out your Bitmap fields and call GC.Collect() in Activity.OnDestroy(). (Even GC.Collect() may not work immediately, and would still require that you null out all Java.Lang.Object-subclass fields...)

I'm not entirely sure how your View is obtaining the array from your Activity...but it might not matter.

Let's assume you have code such as [0]:

	Bitmap[] bitmaps = new Bitmap[100];
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
		bitmaps[i] = BitmapFactory.DecodeFile(...);
	} 

Every Bitmap instance will contain a gref, and gref acts as a GC &quot;root&quot;, preventing the Java VM from collecting the Java-side object [1]. The above will thus necessitate that 100 gref's exist until all 100 Bitmaps instances are Dispose()d, OR the GC is able to collect all of them:

	for (int i = 0; i &lt; bitmaps.Length; i++)
		bitmaps [i].Dispose ();

Can you do better? Somewhat:

	JavaList&lt;Bitmap&gt; bitmaps = new JavaList&lt;Bitmap&gt;();
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
		using (var bitmap = BitmapFactory.DecodeFile (...))
			bitmaps.Add (bitmap);
	}

The `using` ensures that the managed Bitmap peer instance is disposed of ASAP. The above code will require only 1 gref: the gref for the JavaList&lt;Bitmap&gt; instance.

When you access `bitmaps`, a new managed peer will be created, which will acquire a new gref:

	Bitmap b = bitmaps [0];

To ensure that the gref is disposed of as quickly as possible, you'd still want to Dispose() of it:

	using (var b = bitmaps [0])
		DoSomethingWithTheBitmap (b);

However, since JavaList&lt;Bitmap&gt; still has a gref, everything it references will also be kept alive. You'll have 1 gref, but you still have 100 Bitmap instance hanging around at once. To allow Dalvik to collect them, you need to release the gref:

	bitmaps.Dispose ();

The `bitmaps.Dispose()` call could thus go in Activity.OnDestroy()
