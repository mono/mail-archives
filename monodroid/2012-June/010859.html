<PRE>I'm doubting I can make an impact but please listen to some feedback from
someone who just started out with Mono for Android.

Using Visual Studio to develop android applications is really a joy.
Deploying on the emulator is another experience.
Its really unworkable slow and it takes the fun out of using and
experiencing the actual app.

I understand that the evaluation version is designed so that the app cannot
reach the marker place and be used for a commercial activity.
If this is the only constraint that please rethink how it's currently done.

There are other ways to prevent commercial deployment by for example
crippling the app, putting a time limit on the execution, show a message box
every x seconds,...
If this is in place the app will be useless in a commercial setting but we
can still enjoy physical deployment, and fast debugging!.

My scenario is that I want to become productive on android, ios and WP but I
first have to pass the learning curve. It will take a few months to get a
good product and as a single enthousiast I cannot afford to spend 600 $.
Once the app is finished and I am ready to deploy it to the market place I
will be ready to buy the licenses. 

Please reconsider this as it will make more developers use it to the point
they have a working app.
