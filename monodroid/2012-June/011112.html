<PRE>I've been looking, as a fan of mono-droid since before it was incepted, for
someone to contribute to this project. I talked to jon earlier about the
lack of profiling support and I know there are neat ways to do it. He
suggested some stuff to me, however, I'm looking for something simpler.

I want something like this:
<A HREF="http://www.sharpcrafters.com/postsharp/documentation#getting-started">http://www.sharpcrafters.com/postsharp/documentation#getting-started</A>

If I built some code around this would people on this list actually use it?
It would tell you how much memory a function uses and how long before it
it's cleaned.


I make a lot of money off residuals so I wanna help other people. If a few
people reply back and say they will be my guinea pigs I will write this.

Of course, andrew taylor and anyone associate with my previous project
would be barred in my tos. To everyone else I won't even charge, it'll be
free.
