<PRE>I need to be able to type and validate at the same time in a WebView. The
typing accesses either a local Sqlite cache or and online database if
available.

I can't use loadUrl as it always hides the soft keyboard on every key
stroke.
I also can't use a Javascript interface as it can't take callbacks to the
Javascript ( only takes primitive data types ).

I'm now having to look at a really messy solution to solve the problem.
ie.  Place a request through the Javascript interface and then setup a
polling timer in Javascript and check the result back through the Javascript
interface. Unfortunately I'll have to set up timers for every input field
that needs to go back to the database, and also find some way to interlock
similar requests on diferent input fields (Yuck).

Does anybody know of another way to do this?

Thanks in advance.
Terry.
