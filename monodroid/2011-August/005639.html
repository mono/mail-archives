<PRE>We've been getting a lot of pressure from management (sales) to support
smart phones other than Windows.  We started to look at MonoDroid and
then Novell kicked (actually got sold) the project and staff to the curb
so we stopped our plans.  Now that Xamarin (I'd like to know what that
means and how to pronounce it) is back and it seems to be a production
ready solution, I've been asked to restart a proof of concept which I've
been working on so we can put together a project plan.  

 

I've got most of the application figured out and broken down so we can
design business layer, application functions, communications, and user
interface.  I am then hoping to be able to change out the user interface
and then have a port to the iPad (which is where all the sales teams are
saying the sales are).

 

So here's the overall questions I'm stuck with.

 

Here's my two design questions:

 

1.  In our PC/Windows phone application we check our version against a
service and if there's a new release, we download it and upgrade.  So,
going through this, I see Android and iOS use a sandbox concept
differing from what I'm familiar with.   So, how does one handle
updates? Is it possible to download a program and once it gets
downloaded it runs and replaces the application?

 

2.  Secondly, one of our applications is a business application that
runs on the sales staff's company owned phone/tablets.  Company's own
these devices and put them in the field and part of the business
requirement is to make the sales application password protected so it
cannot be uninstalled (which also deletes all the sales records).  Is
there a way to set a pin so an app cannot be removed?  All I can come up
with is a 'watch dog' approach where you have two applications each
monitoring the broadcast message for package removal and then reloads it
unless a pin is entered (but the sales data would be lost however I
could resync from the server).  But, this seems a little to much like
malware.  Can I somehow drop the application into the system/application
store thereby making it a system application?  Or how do you handle this
business requirement?

 

 

Thanks,

Tim
