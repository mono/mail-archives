<PRE>Hi,

I think, monodroid does not provide full support for WCF web service. Due to
which we need to do mannual changes into the Reference.cs code file. This
file is get generated when we add a web reference in our project.

I think the below issue has the XML Serialization issue and due to which I
have commented below attribute/line from all the classes in Reference.cs.
//[System.Xml.Serialization.XmlIncludeAttribute(typeof(clsPerson))]

Now I am able to create the object of web service and also consumed one
method from the web service synchronously. but whenever the method returns
the complex data the method call does not gives any reponse nor any error. 

Also the synchronous web method call is not a good develoment practise as
web service may take several time to respond. Due to which, I tried to call
the method asynchronously but still it has the issues and these method call
also does not give any response as well as not gives any error.

Please help me to resolve this issue.

Thanks,
Nilesh
