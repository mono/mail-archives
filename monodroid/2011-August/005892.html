I'm not sure how SQLite would trigger a NoClassDefFoundError. This only happens when a Java-side type can't be found, and Mono.Data.Sqlite has no Java-side types involved.

</I>
For reasons I cannot currently fathom, Mono.Data.Sqlite is listed as System.Data.SQLite within the Add Reference dialog in Visual Studio, and after selecting it the Assembly References section contains Mono.Data.Sqlite. I don't know why this is happening. :-(

&gt;<i> I found references to SQLite working with Mono Android but for some reason I can't get it working!
</I>
It would also be useful to provide sample code and error messages, if available. All I can say is that it works for me (though I still need to provide a public sample that actually uses Mono.Data.Sqlite...).
