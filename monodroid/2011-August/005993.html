Yeah, I don't disagree at all.  I do agree that the debugging issues are hurting sales as I had some folks at a company I know of locally that just wouldn't use Mono 4 Android given the status of debugging.  I'm not trying to jump on the bandwagon and beat on anyone.  I realize that the debugging experience is much better on my mac with mono for android and monodevelop there.  However, telling a .NET developer that they will get a better development experience on the mac with mono develop as opposed to visual studio on windows and they will look at you like you have lost your mind.
Having said the above, I do think we all need to give the guys a chance to get things working with regards to debugging.  Remember, there was NO debugging in mono touch when it first shipped and was that way for about a 6 weeks until MT 1.2.x sometime afterwards.

</I>&gt;<i> The horrifically slow speed of the emulator is basically making 
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation impossible, as simply tracing from one line to the next in 
</I>&gt;<i> the debugger ( VS2k10 )can take 20 seconds up to several minutes, 
</I>&gt;<i> evaluating a variable is simply not worth it, several minutes if VS 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't simply lock up.  At this point I frankly gave up.  I used 
</I>&gt;<i> Java/Eclipse for some Android development and the emulator was bad, but 
</I>&gt;<i> not this bad.  I even created a 1.6 device with a super low resolution 
</I>&gt;<i> screen, turned off animations via command line switch and it was still 
</I>&gt;<i> completely unusable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When debugging on device, is it any better?  I am am unwilling to buy 
</I>&gt;<i> the full version based on what I have seen thus far, the development 
</I>&gt;<i> pipeline is just simply broken.  Is there, or will there be, an option 
</I>&gt;<i> for a time limited trial so we can try it against an actual device?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As it stands now, with the awful emulator support, your trial program is 
</I>&gt;<i> probably losing you more customers than anything.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Shrink the display size to the smallest you can get away with. As per [0], at about the 40 minute mark, a major reason for the emulator's slowness (in addition to emulating an ARM CPU) is graphics: the entire video pipeline is done in software, in ARM, in the emulator. Shrinking the emulator size as much as possible reduces what needs to be rendered, speeding things up.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, the emulator is slow as balls. Even Google admits to it.
