<PRE>Hello Jon,

Thanks for your answer. How will MonoDroid 1.1 compared to using java
to create a MapView?

I was playing around Windows Phone 7 Bing maps the other day and it
was super easy to set up. Just edit the xaml code and I had a map,
with controls to zoom and pushpins on the map and could easily do that
dynamically as they are simple user controls, is that even possible
doing in MonoDroid when you have to wrap stuff up this way to even get
a map shown? Are there some examples I can look at because I find that
sample a bit lacking. I suppose there should be a way to communicate
with the intent launched with the map, but how?

Also the instructions are a bit complicated just to get a map shown on your screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of that complication is due to Android itself. For example, the &quot;normal&quot; emulator Targets (e.g. &quot;Android 2.2 - API Level 8&quot;) lack Google Maps support, and you need to use a different Target when creating the emulator (e.g. &quot;Google APIs (Google Inc.) - API Level 8&quot;). This adds complexity, as you can't use any previously created emulator devices, you need to create (and remember to run!) a new one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then we get to the Google Maps API itself, which further requires that your app have an API key, which you need to separately obtain and insert into the Resources\Layout\Map.axml file. If you don't get your own API key, then you get just a grid and not a map (as you see).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry that it's so complicated, but the above is &quot;necessary&quot; complexity (at least until Google decides to simplify things). Even when Mono for Android allows you to subclass MapActivity from C#, you will still need to remember to create an emulator with the appropriate Target, and you will still need to separately obtain an API key for the Google Maps API. There's not a lot that Mono for Android can do there, and Java is no better. :-(
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any suggestions on how to improve the README file to clarify any questions, I would be more than happy to improve it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
