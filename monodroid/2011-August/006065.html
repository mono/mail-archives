I have just uninstalled the M4A addin, which is version 2.6.5.  I get the message that Mono.Posix.dll referenced in the manifest could not be found.  I have gone back out to the gallery and seen that version 2.6.5.4 is available.  I have installed it, however, I have received the message that Mono.Posix.dll is not available after the install.  After I closed MD down once again and reloaded it, the project does seem to load, compile, and start the android emulator.  The debugger seems to think that it is running now, but I don't see the app running in the emulator.  In fact, I don't see the app on the emulator.  I don't see any notification that anything is happening.  I can see some things happening according to the task manager, but I don't see anything happening.  I'm guessing that the lack of a dialog box up communicating what is happening is what is causing me the problem.
I have switched over to VS 2010.  When I load this same project in VS, i do get a message that the app is being installed as well as installing the most recent framework.

Hi,
It looks like a previous install of the MfA addin for 2.6b3 is causing issues there :/ What version is the MfA addin on the addin manager? Do you have an update available for it there?

I wanted to check out mono for android running with Monodevelop for windows.  I have downloaded and installed MD 2.6rc1.  I have reinstalled M4A 1.0.3 that came out last week.  Unfortunately, when I load the intro project, I get the message:

 
Could not load project 'C:\Projects\AnDevCon\01 - MonoDroidIntroApp\MonoDroidIntroApp\MonoDroidIntroApp.csproj' with unknown item type '{EFBA0AD7-5A72-4C68-AF49-83D382785DCF};{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}'

 
When I go to the addin manager for MD and look at Mobile Development -&gt; Mono for Android development, I get the message that:
The following dependcies required by the add-in are not available: Required MonoDevelop.Core v2.6, found 2.5.93.

 
I think the problem is that I don't have the latest version of something installed, but I'm not quite sure what it is.  Any suggestions are appreciated.
 
Wally
