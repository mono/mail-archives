That doesn't make sense to me. You may want to avoid creating the DB in OnCreate() for other reasons (e.g. to keep the app responsive and avoid the Application Not Responding dialog), but creating and using a SQLite database should certainly work within Activity.OnCreate().

If this is still a problem with Mono for Android 1.0.3, could you file a complete test case so that we can more easily determine what the problem is?

Thanks,
