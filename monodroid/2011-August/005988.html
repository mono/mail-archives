<PRE>Thanks Jon, I'll try and get a reproducible scenario wrapped up.

Is a .apk on its own any use to you or do you need the whole project?

Testing today I've found that putting in loads of GC.Collect(0)s doesn't
make the hanging go away (ie. it GCs small amounts of data frequently but
then, all of a sudden, it'll hang for X minutes without a &quot;force close&quot; type
message and then happily continue processing.) But no crashes!!!

If I replace the GC.Collect(0) with GC.Collect(1) then I'm more likely to
see an old-style crash.

As you say, it's as though the hard crash is replaced by a hang. Nicer from
the programmer's point of view because the app is still running, but more
irritating for an end user because things tend to re-start quickly after a
crash whereas they have to wait around during a hang.

I'll try and get something to you to illustrate all of this.

Cheers,

Andy

So we've gone from &quot;the app crashes randomly, instantly, with no recourse&quot;
to &quot;the app hangs, but eventually comes back.&quot; This is an improvement, but
not perfect.

Unfortunately none of the bugs I've looked at to date have exhibited the
multi-minute GC hangs you're reporting. Would it be possible for you to file
a bug for this and attach a project exhibiting this issue?

Thanks,
