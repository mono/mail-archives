When that happens, before you reboot the emulator, try opening the Browser app and seeing if you can navigate to a URL. Is it a system wide loss of DNS/etc., or is it local to your app?

What I've noticed in testing with the emulator is that frequently when the emulator boots it has no networking, and Browser won't be able to load anything (which breaks my test app, which also tries a network request w/o any graceful error catching). Restarting the emulator fixes this problem (as I haven't explored enough to figure out why the emulator is coming up w/o networking in the first place).

This may or may not be related to the issues you're seeing; I have no idea. It does bring up a major point, though: you can't expect to have &quot;always accessible&quot; networking on the device, so you should try checking the network connection status before you fire off your network requests (adapted from <A HREF="http://www.androidpeople.com/android-how-check-network-statusboth-wifi-and-mobile-3g">http://www.androidpeople.com/android-how-check-network-statusboth-wifi-and-mobile-3g</A>):

	static bool IsNetworkAvailable (Context context)
	{
		// requires the android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission
		var manager = (Android.Net.ConnectivityManager) context.GetSystemService(Context.ConnectivityService);
		var wifi = manager.GetNeworkInfo (Android.Net.ConnectivityType.Wifi);
		var mobile = manager.GetNetworkInfo (Android.Net.ConnectivityType.Mobile);
		bool online = wifi.IsAvailable || mobile.IsAvailable;
		return online;
	}

This may help your app, it may not; it's my current best guess. :-)
