<PRE>Sure, I'll have to strip out all the crap I got in there that is
business logic.  But I think you can recreate it by doing the following:

 

1.  Build the hello world app.

2.  Add a service to start when the Activity starts

3.  Have the service create a new thread and a handler back to the
service.

4.  Now in this new thread.  I loop endlessly, and sleep for 1 minute.
When it wakes up, it calls back to the handler in the service thread
which does a Toast &quot;Hello another loop&quot;.

 

This runs endlessly on Java.  In monodroid, it stops after an hour or
so. If you take out the call back to the service handler and just log
it, you see the same thing.  

 

I'll try to code this and get it posted.  But basically that's it. 

 

Tim

Hi Tim,

 

Do you have a sample test case that illustrates this bug that you could
attach to <A HREF="http://bugzilla.xamarin.com?">http://bugzilla.xamarin.com?</A> If this is a bug in Mono for
Android, and it sounds like it very well could be, we'd be very
interested in fixing this bug.

Has anyone noticed that after a while a program just stops running in
the emulator?   Not sure if this behavior happens on a real device.
This has me concerned and thinking maybe there's underlying issues.

 

Anyway, I have an application that creates a service.  This service
creates a thread, sleeps and loops writing to the log and doing other
proof of concept work.  After about an hour or so it just stops working.
The log file is never written to again nor are any of the proof of
concepts working.  If you click on the menu/settings on the Droid
emulator and look a Applications running, the program and service is
still running.  You can click on the application and the interface comes
up, just the service is dead.

 

Now just for the heck of it, I programmed the same service in Eclipse
with Java with the exact same functions.  When this program runs, it
runs forever, just like you'd expect.

 

So why both applications you might ask?  I'm bench testing MonoDroid and
Java based on business requirements for management.  I'd like to use C#
so we have a cross platform solution but I have to ensure MonoDroid
works.

 

 

So, I'm concerned that if we deploy an application that it will stop
running requiring reboots.  If it's an emulator problem that's
explainable, but if not then using MonoDroid will be out of the
question???  And this behavior in Java on the emulator is not seen.
