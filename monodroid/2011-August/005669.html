<PRE>Has anyone noticed that after a while a program just stops running in
the emulator?   Not sure if this behavior happens on a real device.
This has me concerned and thinking maybe there's underlying issues.

 

Anyway, I have an application that creates a service.  This service
creates a thread, sleeps and loops writing to the log and doing other
proof of concept work.  After about an hour or so it just stops working.
The log file is never written to again nor are any of the proof of
concepts working.  If you click on the menu/settings on the Droid
emulator and look a Applications running, the program and service is
still running.  You can click on the application and the interface comes
up, just the service is dead.

 

Now just for the heck of it, I programmed the same service in Eclipse
with Java with the exact same functions.  When this program runs, it
runs forever, just like you'd expect.

 

So why both applications you might ask?  I'm bench testing MonoDroid and
Java based on business requirements for management.  I'd like to use C#
so we have a cross platform solution but I have to ensure MonoDroid
works.

 

 

So, I'm concerned that if we deploy an application that it will stop
running requiring reboots.  If it's an emulator problem that's
explainable, but if not then using MonoDroid will be out of the
question???  And this behavior in Java on the emulator is not seen.
