<PRE>Thanks Jonathan.
I've seen that even if I don't try to use resources we can't put
anything UI related in library projects.
For example:
I have a Library project (lets call it LibProj)
I have an Activity (Activity1) in LibProj which loads a layout using 

SetContentView(Resource.Layout.Main); 

The Layout Main.axml is within that library project.

Now I have a Mono Android Application Project (AppProj) which references
LibProj and then creates an intent to start a Activity1:

Intent intent = new Intent(this, typeof(LibProj.Activity1));
StartActivity(intent);


What happens to this call completely depends on what const Id was
generated for Resource.Layout.Main and if the AppProj has something in
the Resource file with a similar Id. I've seen it loading a completely
different layout (a layout defined in AppProj).

With this behavior, it's almost impossible to use Library projects
except for business logic (I guess that's why the Resource folder
hierarchy is not generated in Library projects). Anything UI related
(Activity, View, Layout etc) have to be put in the Application Project.

I certainly hope this is something that gets fixed soonish otherwise
it'll make it very difficult for us to develop applications of any
decent complexity using Mono for Android if we have to put all UI stuff
in one project.

There is currently no support for sharing resources across projects.

You will need to copy (or link) the resources into each project.

Hopefully there will eventually be a better solution for this.
