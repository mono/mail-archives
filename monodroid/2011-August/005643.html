<PRE>Jon,

Thanks for the thoughts.  I can scrap automatic updates and post a Toast
saying there's an update available and they need to go get it.

Xamarin is now on my least favorite words to say like Linux which I
never say or hear anyone say correctly.  So for me, it's MonoDroid and
I'll leave the monkey pronunciation to management because that's more
inline with their species anyway.

We cache data back and forth, so we plan on doing what you suggest as
soon as a connection is available.  So, it will be all the offline sales
we'd loose or would loose if someone purged user data.

How about this Business requirement?  Is there a way to lock a device?
What really happens, according to management is, they fire a sales
person and they wipe the phone/tablet.  I can 'hot glue' the reset hole
to make it difficult physically but with that done, how would you lock
the software?  

Here's my thoughts.  Have a background thread running that keeps
starting and bring to the top a user interface that has an image with a
place to enter a password?  If they click off, can't I just bring it
back in front?

&quot;Xamarin&quot; rhymes with &quot;Tamarin&quot; (the monkey species), with the &quot;X&quot;
sounding phonetically like a 'Z' (like in Xylophone).

&gt;<i> 1.  In our PC/Windows phone application we check our version against a
</I>service and if there's a new release, we download it and upgrade.  So,
going through this, I see Android and iOS use a sandbox concept
differing from what I'm familiar with.   So, how does one handle
updates?

Normally the user needs to update the app, e.g. on the iPhone by
starting the App Store app, tapping the Updates icon, and then tapping
the Update All button.

I believe my Android device uses the notification tray to tell me when
updates are available, but it's still up to me (the user) to actually
update the app.

&gt;<i> Is it possible to download a program and once it gets downloaded it
</I>runs and replaces the application?

On iOS? No. On Android, a full JIT is available, so you could in
principal download the new assemblies, place them into some well-known
location, then use Assembly.LoadFrom() to load the assemblies. There
would be lots of reflection involved, but it could be done.

However, this approach may also be very brittle, given that the default
Release behavior is to link the apps so that only the parts of the base
class library that are actually used are present in the final app (in an
effort to shrink app sizes):

	<A HREF="http://android.xamarin.com/Documentation/Linking">http://android.xamarin.com/Documentation/Linking</A>

Consequently, if's entirely plausible that any assemblies you provide
through your update mechanism may refer to types and members that don't
exist within your app, unless you disable linking or skip linking on a
particular set of types (which will increase your app size).

Given that you mentioned iPad support, it's moot anyway (there's no JIT
on iOS).

&gt;<i> 2. Company's own these devices and put them in the field and part of
</I>the business requirement is to make the sales application password
protected so it cannot be uninstalled (which also deletes all the sales
records). Is there a way to set a pin so an app cannot be removed?

Let's split up these two issues. :-)

It should be fairly straightforward to have your app cache data locally,
and upload the sales records whenever a network is available. This way
you won't lose (as many) sales records.

As for preventing app removal, I don't know of any such mechanism
(though I'm no expert either).

&gt;<i> All I can come up with is a 'watch dog' approach where you have two
</I>applications each monitoring the broadcast message for package removal
and then reloads it unless a pin is entered

Which only works on Android, not iOS (as iOS doesn't have concepts of
Services or BroadcastReceivers or...). Unless there's some way of
indicating that an app can't be uninstalled (and there very well may be,
I don't know), this approach can't work on the iPad.

&gt;<i> Or how do you handle this business requirement?
</I>
More research. :-)

For example, on iOS there's:

	
<A HREF="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Enterprise_Deployment_Guide.pdf">http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/Enterprise_Deployment_Guide.pdf</A>

Chapter 2, Restriction Settings section (page 33) has a &quot;Allow
installing apps&quot; setting, which allows disabling the ability to install
additional apps. Perhaps this also controls removal of apps as well? I
don't know.

Android may have a similar mechanism; again, I don't know.
