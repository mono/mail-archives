<PRE>I assure you it is definitely throwing this exception, the LogCat output
doesn't really include anything else of relevance that I noticed.  I will
take another look and see just to make sure, I removed the code so I will
have to add it all back.  

I added a reference to that assembly you are mentioning and it did not seem
to fix it, the only thing I can think of is that I was calling the DB in my
onCreate method for the launcher activity, which may be too early in the app
lifecycle.  I didn't think about that until just now, I will try moving it
off somewhere more further down.

I followed these instructions:

The first try I was using sql-net, so I removed it thinking it was some
weird issued with that library.  Once I removed it I received the exact same
exception working with the cursor directly.

Maybe I'll be more successful on my second attempt!!
