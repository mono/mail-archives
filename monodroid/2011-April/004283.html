We have fixed some debugger issues from the previews in 1.0.  There are
still some known issues that we are working on for upcoming releases.
We encourage you to file bug reports for any that are not already filed
and to CC yourself on any open bug reports to be notified when they have
been resolved.

We do not have a fixed schedule, but we do intend to be responsive to
our users with bugfix releases as we have done in the past with the
MonoTouch product and the Mono for Android previews.
