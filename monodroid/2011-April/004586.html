<PRE>Hi all,

I am currently porting a Mobile Banking App that creates a background worker
thread which does a lot of network access and processing. Unfortunately,
when updating many accounts online the backgroud thread always crashes the
App (black screen and restart of the App). The very same code works
flawlessly on the .NET Framework (desktop), on Windows Mobile .NETCF and
even on the iPhone with MonoTouch. The captured logging output lets me
assume that the problem is perhaps somewhere in the GC of MonoDroid.

Here is the logging, captured with todays Mono for Android 1.0.1 release on
a LG Optimus One device with Android 2.2:

I/ActivityManager( 1372): Displayed activity
subsembly.banking/.OnlineBankingActivity: 892 ms (total 892 ms)
I/MainActivity(26143): OnStop
F/MonoDroid(26143): ERROR: Unable to detach current thread from the Java VM!
F/MonoDroid(26143): ERROR: Unable to detach current thread from the Java VM!
F/MonoDroid(26143): ERROR: Unable to detach current thread from the Java VM!
F/MonoDroid(26143): ERROR: Unable to detach current thread from the Java VM!
F/MonoDroid(26143): ERROR: Unable to detach current thread from the Java VM!
F/mono    (26143): * Assertion: should not be reached at
../../../../mono/metadata/sgen-marksweep.c:279
I/ActivityManager( 1372): Process subsembly.banking (pid 26143) has died.

I wonder what these &quot;ERROR: Unable to detach current thread from the Java
VM!&quot; mean. They often occur but usually do not seem to be harmful.

The assertion from &quot;sgen-marksweep.c&quot; is what makes me assume that the
problem could perhaps be due to the GC.

As an addtional info: The background thread uses a Activity.RunOnUiThread()
callback in order to post progress information to the GUI. Could it be that
issue documented under &quot;Dalvik GC&quot; on the page
<A HREF="http://mono-android.net/Documentation/GC">http://mono-android.net/Documentation/GC</A> has something to do with the
problem? To be honest, I still do not understand that issue.

Andreas
