<PRE>Initially, I thought it was something that I was doing, but I did the
following: (1) uninstall everything but VS2010; (2) reinstall the SDK, Mono,
and create the instance; (3) start a new project with the standard template;
and (4) making no changes, debug it on the emulator.

 

Randomly, for example after 50 clicks of the button, the Visual Studio
Debugger disconnects from the emulator. The application continues to run on
the emulator and works fine, but the debugger exits. The exit message is
below, and I cannot find any resources to take it further. I checked the
Output (which only has the exit message), the log on the desktop and the
Android Device Logging window. Sometimes all I have to do is let it sit and
it will disconnect. 

 

The message is: The program 'Mono' has exited with code 255 (0xff).

 

Let me know what information I should be looking for to determine the
problem or what the message indicates. I didn't have this problem with the
last preview and it really just showed up in the release. But this seems to
be a showstopper that would lead to a quick exit from developing in Mono on
the Android. 

 

Thanks.

Dennis Quebe
