<PRE>I wanted to take a moment and commend all of the folks that have a
hand in the fantastic Mono for Android product - kudos and continued
success!

Secondly, I want to toot my own horn with the following self promoting
blurb for the open source library I support:

***

I am pleased to announce that the next release of Software is Hardwork
Library, 4.2.0, will fully support the Android platform via the Mono
for Android product. Platform &#8220;spackle&#8221; code which bridges a few minor
differences will also be released as an open source offering to ensure
full compatibility. Software is Hardwork Library 4.2.0 is currently
being used in the construction of real world Android applications.

This means that the features such as the &#8220;type map&#8221; data access
framework (targeting the SQLite on-device RDBMS &#8211; reference code to be
open sourced as well) and the &#8220;text metal&#8221; template framework (with
SQLite model/map templates open source as well) both execute same-same
on an Android device.

In addition, text metal templates to generate basic view XML will be released.

This signifies a milestone in the maturity and architecture of the
Software is Hardwork Library! No release date is available.

***

Email me directly for additional information. This is an open source
project and nothing is being sold or profited.


In a nutshell: for example, a well layered WinForms applications which
leveraged the Software is Hardwork Library, a SQL CE database was
ported to Android sans UI almost untouched! The UI was generated from
the data model and hand tweaked....etc.


Thanks,
