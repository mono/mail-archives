<PRE>Novell isn&#8217;t the only one, a lot of companies do the following

 

In the US store they list 99$

In the euro store they list 99&#8364;

 

I know Embarcadero does the same, and if you watch closely there are a lot more out there

I found the same for the Australian price.  It was significantly higher than the exchange rate said it should be, even if our 10% GST was taken into account.  I ended up buying the special deal for existing MonoTouch licensees through the US store rather than the Asia Pacific outlet so I didn't get over-charged.  Our dollar is currently valued higher than the US dollar, but the current comparison is USD$399 to AUD$459 in the two Novell stores.

I'm not sure why it is.  Novell are not the only US company to charge much higher than the exchange rate for digitally delivered products.

On a Novell store I found that the price for Enterprize edition licence for european developers is significantly higher than $999 per licence - price officialy claimed on the hompage of mono for android.

For us European based developers the price set on Novell store is 830,00 EUR per licence, which is more than 999 USD (on xe.com or google: 999 USD = 689 EUR which is far less than 830,00 on Novell). 

Is it just me, or there is some reasonable explanation for this?
If 140EUR is shipping price for European based developers?
