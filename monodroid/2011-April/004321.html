<PRE>I was looking at the same thing using a default image from Microsoft for
Visual Studio 2010, but I didn't install the Java 64-bit version, and it
still had the problem. It actually has no default Java installed. Granted
this is not a &quot;clean&quot; machine from my perspective, but it is another
machine. I am in the process of uninstalling Java 64-bit (since I had both
versions), but I don't expect that to make a difference. If by some reason
it auto-magically starts working, I won't be able to tell you want do
because of how many changes were made. If it doesn't start working soon, I
guess I will go and find another product and community.

Dennis/Christian,

 

It looks like it has nothing at all to do with having previous versions
installed

 

Last night I installed VS2010 and Mono on my daughters machine

 

Her's is a fresh install of Windows 7

 

She never had visual studio or monodrod before

 

And I am getting the same error &quot;The program 'Mono' has exited with code 255
(0xff).&quot;

 

We are both running 64 bit versions of the OS

 

We both have had Java 64 and 32 bit versions installed

I'm not sure what the problem is, and I haven't heard any official word. I
am assuming that you see the &quot;The program 'Mono' has exited with code 255
(0xff).&quot; message in output (confirm or let me know if there is a different
message). I am doing some testing with some virtual machines to see if the
commonality between those that don't work is that we had the previous
version installed before installing the release. 

 

My version is Professional 10.0.30319.1 RTMRel.

I have VS 2010 SP1 - uninstalled the MD beta before installing the MD v1.0

Yes. I don't have an answer. What version of Visual Studio are you using?
Did you have the previous Beta installed before installing the release?

Has anybody else seen this?

No error, no exception - VS just goes out of debugging mode but the app
still runs in the emulator.

 

Thanks,

-Christian
