<PRE>You mentioned that you had a previous version of Mono on there before
uninstalling and installing the release. Did the other box have a prior
version? I wonder if something is being left behind from the uninstall. I
have another development machine that has the same problem, but of course it
is similar to this one (as far as version, etc.).

Dennis, are you using Ultimate, I don't think my other dev is?  Maybe that's
the difference?

 

I have Ultimate Version 10.0.30319.1 RTMRel

 

I guess my only last resort except formatting my box is to reinstall VS2010

Can we compare development environments between the ones that work and
don't. I can't say that I have installed on a completely clean version of
Visual Studio. Unfortunately, I don't have time to try that. But here is my
environment: 

 

Windows 7 x64; Visual Studio 2008 and 2010; 2010 version 10.0.30319.1
RTMRel; All tools installed with VS 2010; using TFS. Some third-party
components like &quot;Telerik&quot;. 

 

This is frustrating because the lack of information to help form a
diagnosis, and it is discouraging as a development platform due to lack of
consistency and stability.
