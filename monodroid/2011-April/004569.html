<PRE>Jonathan - respect !! 
I do understand a lot of what you said 
I researched the issue of using defines in c# - I know it was knocked on the
head in the development of that language in the interests of
understandability 
In the old days ( oh for <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodroid">g at ds</A> sake John stop harking back!!)  We used to use
macro substitutions - you know the &amp;thisfield when you weren't sure what the
user would select. And yes it was rubbish. 
But I do buy into the simplicity of c# 
And as you said in a previous post  &quot;Whoaa the beauty of xDocument and Linq&quot;
:<i>-) 
</I>
Anyway I am trying to wrap a few functions around this stuff with Contacts 
Liam has helped - and I will post anything useful back to the community 

Look - can I say I am still a massive supporter of what you guys have done
and, Jonathan,  your candid response is very very welcome 

Putting my CEO(retired - washed up, fed up :-) )  hat on -  it comes back to
the mission for Novell - to dispel the barriers inherent in Java and
leverage the skills in c# ( <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodroid">G at d</A> knows what you'd get posted here if you were
doing Visual basic for Android :-) ) - I recognise what you say J about
getting something to market and the difficulty of mapping the Android API -
If it has been a 'bridge too far' (commercially) to do something vastly
improved with the contacts bit then a partial solution is to post some 'how
to's' on the community  As I have said some of the examples go very little
beyond 'hello world' however useful that is.

In the meantime I will continue trying to help the community but can I ask
for some help on how to get notes out of Android contacts in Mono - Greg
where are you ? :-) we need you now 

FWIW  a very long time ago I worked on Psion stuff (EPOC - which became
Symbian ) before the Brits sold up to Nokia et alt. there was a real self
help community which really made massive a difference to the success of
things like the Psion series3 and the Psion guys were dab hands at pump
priming the community- the community is the force !! 
Novell can transform things with all its great work but the community  needs
a little extra help 
There are signs - there's now a forum and increasingly there's more 'how do
I do this' questions rather than bug issues 

But to you Jon and to the rest of the church thanks for your help so far 

Some help on extracting 'notes' pleeeeease ?


Best regards to all 
John Murray

Perhaps a question for the commercial people}

I know the mapping often sucks. Unfortunately, it's the best we could do in
a reasonable timeframe.

The fundamental problem is this: our process for generating 99% of
Mono.Android.dll is to take an XML description of the Android API, run that
through a C# source generator, then compile the resulting source to get
Mono.Android.dll.

This seems terribly reasonable...except for one tiny detail (among lots of
others): Java allows constants within interface bodies (and allows static
methods with method bodies as well, iirc). C# does not. Since a large number
of Java constants are within interfaces, these constants need to be moved
_somewhere_, for which we have two places: the *Consts types (e.g.
Android.OS.BinderConsts) and enumerations.

One alternative approach would be to use IL as the intermediary, but this
would make it difficult (impossible?) to add helper methods to types (we
currently use C# partial classes to permit this).

Unfortunately, I'm not aware of a good solution to this problem, and even
enumerations can be problematic. The enumerations we provide can make some
operations much easier when within an IDE, but when translating Java code to
C# enumerations are yet another renamed type, making it harder to find the
appropriate matching member...
 
&gt;<i> Now try to find out the syntax of the ManagedQuery() from the
</I>documentation
&gt;<i> Type in Managedquery on MonoDroid documentation  - zilch
</I>
I just realized that the Search bar searches mono-android.net, not the docs.
Oops.

We should be migrating to a new documentation backend soon, which will
hopefully allow Google to index our content.

&gt;<i> the 'hint' in VS2010 says its full namespace is
</I>Android.Database.Icursor.Activity.ManagedQuery()

I have no idea where VS2010 came up with this; based on context, it should
be Activity.ManagedQuery:

	
<A HREF="http://docs.mono-android.net/index.aspx?link=M%3aAndroid.App.Activity.Manage">http://docs.mono-android.net/index.aspx?link=M%3aAndroid.App.Activity.Manage</A>
dQuery(Android.Net.Uri%2cSystem.String%5b%5d%2cSystem.String%2cSystem.String
%5b%5d%2cSystem.String)

It should also be noted that the Android API for several areas sucks.
Contacts is one such area.

&gt;<i> I Know I am dreaming and getting delirious here but wouldn't it be nice if
</I>one could just extract what one wanted using a simple sql statement a la
LINQ?

Java doesn't have LINQ.

To rephrase things, Mono for Android 1.0 was simply about getting something
that _worked_. Not necessarily something that worked well, and given that we
are intentionally exposing as much of the underlying Java API as is
practical, a lot of &quot;Java-isms&quot; get through which make for really, really,
bad C# (or make it harder to translate between Java &amp; C#, e.g. constants).

We aim to improve this in future releases, but there is still the
fundamental tension of exposing the underlying API in an invokable fashion
(even if that means means &quot;I'd rather be pulling teeth&quot;; at least  you don't
need to resort to raw JNI invocations to do it...).

For some areas (and Contacts certainly comes to mind), we might be better
off just completely hiding the Android API and exposing something...sane. We
wouldn't want do do that for everything, but for some areas this may be
best. We'll need to consider such areas as they're reported to us (and we
welcome any and all API feedback in bugzilla ;-).

Thanks,

 - Jon
