Yes. Note, though, that on Android it's just .xml. We renamed it to .axml so that we could provide some code completion support.

&gt;<i> And could I then enumerate the attribute sets?
</I>
Sadly, no. The actual set of supported attributes is defined by Java source code; there is no XML schema/DTD/etc. (The one we have was painstakingly created by grepping Java source.)

Furthermore, due to it's design, any View subclass can also be used within XML, and any subclass can add support for additional attributes. There is no way to declaratively determine the full set of valid XML attributes.

(For this and other reasons, I vastly prefer XAML as Microsoft defined it.)

&gt;<i> Like you mentioned &quot;RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.AddRule()&quot; - does the LayoutParams have a Rules collection I can read etc?
</I>
You can read the Java source ;-)

Again, there is no Android mechanism to programmatically/declaratively determine the supported set of XML attributes. This includes RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.AddRule() &amp; co.

If you want to play around a bit, you could investigate xamldroid:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/atsushieno/xamldroid">https://github.com/atsushieno/xamldroid</A>

As the README says, it doesn't work yet, but it's an effort at allowing Android Views to be used with XAML. I would love to get something like this into Mono.Android.dll proper (no roadmap, no timeline, no announcements yet!), but as part of such work we'd need to find all the bizarro &quot;corner cases&quot; such as RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.AddRules() and provide a XAML-callable form. xamldroid may be the ideal place to store such information, e.g. provide a XamlRelativeLayout.LayoutAlignRules property which would call AddRules() in the setter.

I have no idea how feasible/practical this is, but it would make an interesting &quot;research project&quot; if someone had the time. :-)
