<PRE>Jon,

Thank you for the detailed explanation.  That is the setup we have (sharing the code files with projects for each target) - it's slightly cumbersome, but it works.  The thing that makes it slightly more painful for us is that we are supporting Windows Mobile 6.5, which can only be worked on in Visual Studio 2008.  To add a file, we have to apply the change in Visual Studio 2010, using the project linker extension to update the M4A and MT projects, and then apply the same change in VS 2008 so the Windows Mobile project gets in sync.  It's not the best workflow, but the benefits far outweigh the inconvenience of it.  I was just hoping there might be an easier way.

All that being said, I just want to reiterate how much I appreciate the amount of code sharing that MonoTouch and Mono for Android have allowed us to accomplish.

Thanks again,

No, because MfA and MT have a different set of types. .NET 4.0 mscorlib.dll contains e.g. Microsoft.Win32.Registry and related types, which MonoTouch and Mono for Android lack (though the mscorlib.dll differences are rather small). System.dll, though, is lacking System.CodeDom, more Microsoft.Win32 types, System.Configuration, lots of System.Diagnostics, etc.

The types and members that are &quot;missing&quot; are in-line with what Silverlight/WP7 are missing, compared to desktop .NET.

In any event, until all parties fully support Portable Libraries, it isn't safe to take assemblies built against one profile and run them against another. It _may_ work, but it might not. The safest way to go is to have separate projects per runtime target, and Link your source code into each project. This allows you to have one set of source code and one set of assemblies per target platform.

 - Jon
