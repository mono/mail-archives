<PRE>Why does the 4.2 alpha version of Mono.Android.dll have a publickeytoken of c4c4237547e4b6cd whereas previous versions had one of null? As far as I know, binding redirection won't allow a work around on this, so previous 3rd party libraries can't be used because of this.

Actually the work-around I presented here does not seem to work after all.
It does fix the bug, but Android doesn't always reset statics when the app exits normally, so this can cause it to exit the app right after you launch it.  Instead, it's necessary to keep track of the number of instances that exist in memory:





    [Activity(MainLauncher = true)]

    public class Activity1 : Activity

    {

        private static int _numInstances = 0;



        protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)

        {

            base.OnCreate(bundle);



            _numInstances++;



            if (_numInstances &gt; 1)

                this.Finish();

            else

            {

                var btn = new Button(this);

                btn.Text = &quot;One&quot;;

                btn.Click += (s, e) =&gt;
this.StartActivity(typeof(Activity2));



                SetContentView(btn);

            }

        }



        protected override void OnDestroy()

        {

            base.OnDestroy();



            _numInstances--;

        }

    }

Hey Jon,



Thanks for the reply, but I think this issue is actually a new bug and not the same bug as what you linked.  In case you didn't realize, both of the links you gave me were written by me.



The differences are:



1.       That old bug did repro 100% of the time for me in 1.9.2, regardless
of the circumstances.  In this new bug, it works sometimes, but fails in specific circumstances.  I do believe that old bug was fixed in 4.0.1 as the bug describes, as everything worked great for me in 4.0.1.

2.       Under the old bug, the app was simply reverting to the first
activity.  That is, in the sample code below, Activity2 would simply be
getting deleted.    In this new bug, a new copy of the first activity is
created and pushed onto the stack.



The old bug was just a nuisance as it meant if the app was interrupted by a phone call or something the user just lost their state and had to start
over.   However, this new bug is far worse, since it leaves the app sort of
in a corrupt state with activities all out of order.



With the steps outlined, I can repro this 100% of the time.  If you try my steps and it doesn't repro for you, let me know and we can try to find the difference between our environments.



I wish I could go back to an earlier version of MfA, but 4.0.6 has the fix to allow ICS devices to use OpenTK apps, which is essential to me.  This restarting bug is the only thing preventing me from releasing my app to ICS users and they're growing restless J



The old bug was also impossible to work-around, since the activities were actually getting deleted.  This new bug can actually be fixed if you manually try to detect MfA creating a second instance of your main activity:



    [Activity(MainLauncher = true)]

    public class Activity1 : Activity

    {

        private static bool _exists = false;



        protected override void OnCreate(Bundle bundle)

        {

            Log.Info(&quot;&quot;, &quot;Activity1.OnCreate&quot;);

            base.OnCreate(bundle);



            if (_exists)

                this.Finish();

            else

            {

                _exists = true;



                var btn = new Button(this);

                btn.Text = &quot;One&quot;;

                btn.Click += (s, e) =&gt;
this.StartActivity(typeof(Activity2));



                SetContentView(btn);

            }

        }

    }



This is obviously pretty hacky, but it works.  With this code, the new copy of Activity1 gets closed as soon as it's opened and the app works as expected.  I'm still debating whether or not I should release my app this way.

This is known, but I haven't been able to figure out why it happens yet:

Like you, I've had no luck getting a sample that repros 100% of the time, which makes it rather difficult to figure out what's going wrong...



Sorry,

- Jon
