<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> The release notes for 4.0.5 mention that &#8220;this release brings an overhauled

</I>
The objective was to try and fix as much as possible without breaking
compatibility with existing code. The initialization code was
rewritten, the context is now created earlier, the lifecycle of the
context and surface now obeys the android rules (you can only touch a
surface between SurfaceCreated and SurfaceDestroyed), and other things
of that nature. For the most part, those should not affect user code,
which is why they aren't mentioned in the release notes.

&gt;<i> I installed this from the beta channel and I notice that all of the OpenGL
</I>&gt;<i> code now runs on the UI thread, as opposed to 4.0.4 where all of the OpenGL
</I>&gt;<i> code ran on its own dedicated thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a pretty major change, so I was surprised it was not mentioned in
</I>&gt;<i> the release notes.&#160; This means that if a GL view is running at a low
</I>&gt;<i> framerate, all of the native controls on the screen now behave very slowly
</I>&gt;<i> as well, unlike in 4.0.4 where they were independent of each other.&#160; Is this
</I>&gt;<i> intentional?
</I>
No, the runloop runs separately, in its own thread. Only the callbacks
are made on the UI thread, following the common behaviour of OpenTK
and also Android's GLSurfaceView. User code should be as efficient as
possible during these callbacks, to minimize UI delays. You can do
your own background threads for other expensive operations, if needed.

There's been a report of the run loop running slower than requested,
so there's ongoing work to make the runloop more efficient and closer
to the requested fps. There's also some technical difficulties
envolved with creating shared contexts, so we'll try to make those
easier (because they're very useful). Anything else you find that
needs improving, let us know.
