Julian, Unfortunately, I don't know anything about the release dates.  I know that the book is available on the Amazon.com site right now and that my coauthors have started receiving their printed copies from Wiley.  Historically, I have found the Amazon.com listings to have some extra time built into their estimates.  I would guess that the UK release would be sooner than was is listed on their site, but I don't have any hard and fast data to back that up. Wally

Hi, 

 

Is the UK release still going to be in the
middle of April?

 

Thanks

 

Julian

I tend to get emails every so often asking about our Mono for Android
book.  According to the Amazon.com web site, they have received their
copies and are beginning to deliver them.  If you have had a preorder for
the past 10 months, you should get your copy fairly soon.  If you are
wondering about a Kindle version, I assume that is in the works, but I don't
have any knowledge on that.  I would assume that other book sellers are
getting their copies at this time and will soon be turning them around and shipping
them out as well.

 

I had a great group of people to work with.  They are all members of this
mailing list.  Nathan Blevins, Jon Dick, John Croft, and Xamarin's own
Chris Hardy.  I appreciate everything that they did as well as their
patience.  I also appreciate the folks from Wrox.  Their patience and
understanding can't be underestimated.  Jon Pryor and Jonathan Pobst were
great and took everyone of my private emails corgially and didn't once scream
at my idiocy.  Many thanks to Joseph Hill, Miguel, and Nat Friedman as
well!

 

If you haven't purchased a copy, please consider buying 8-10.  They will
make great romantic gifts for that special occassion.

Now, I return you to your development efforts and will limit my next set of
emails to the dumb questions that you are used to out of me.

 

Wally
