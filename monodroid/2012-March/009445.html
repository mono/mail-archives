<PRE>Hi, 

 

Is the UK release still going to be in the middle of April?

 

Thanks

 

Julian

Subject: book finally shipping

 

I tend to get emails every so often asking about our Mono for Android
book.  According to the Amazon.com web site, they have received their
copies and are beginning to deliver them.  If you have had a preorder
for the past 10 months, you should get your copy fairly soon.  If you
are wondering about a Kindle version, I assume that is in the works, but
I don't have any knowledge on that.  I would assume that other book
sellers are getting their copies at this time and will soon be turning
them around and shipping them out as well.
 
I had a great group of people to work with.  They are all members of
this mailing list.  Nathan Blevins, Jon Dick, John Croft, and Xamarin's
own Chris Hardy.  I appreciate everything that they did as well as their
patience.  I also appreciate the folks from Wrox.  Their patience and
understanding can't be underestimated.  Jon Pryor and Jonathan Pobst
were great and took everyone of my private emails corgially and didn't
once scream at my idiocy.  Many thanks to Joseph Hill, Miguel, and Nat
Friedman as well!
 
If you haven't purchased a copy, please consider buying 8-10.  They will
make great romantic gifts for that special occassion.

Now, I return you to your development efforts and will limit my next set
of emails to the dumb questions that you are used to out of me.
 
Wally
