<PRE>Thanks for the explanation!

When you get shared contexts working, can you share a sample app that shows
how to use them?

Also, I noticed that if you Finish() an activity that contains a GL view,
OnRenderFrame and OnUpdateFrame are called at least once after the graphics
context is disposed.  I see &quot;call to OpenGL ES API with no current context&quot;
logged and calling MakeCurrent() or SwapBuffers() throws an
InvalidOperationException in this situation.

Hi,

&gt;<i> The release notes for 4.0.5 mention that &#147;this release brings an 
</I>&gt;<i> overhauled OpenTK/Android backend.&#148; &#160;However, it&#146;s pretty light on the 
</I>&gt;<i> details.&#160; I&#146;d like to hear more about what exactly is changing.
</I>
The objective was to try and fix as much as possible without breaking
compatibility with existing code. The initialization code was rewritten, the
context is now created earlier, the lifecycle of the context and surface now
obeys the android rules (you can only touch a surface between SurfaceCreated
and SurfaceDestroyed), and other things of that nature. For the most part,
those should not affect user code, which is why they aren't mentioned in the
release notes.

&gt;<i> I installed this from the beta channel and I notice that all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenGL code now runs on the UI thread, as opposed to 4.0.4 where all 
</I>&gt;<i> of the OpenGL code ran on its own dedicated thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a pretty major change, so I was surprised it was not mentioned 
</I>&gt;<i> in the release notes.&#160; This means that if a GL view is running at a 
</I>&gt;<i> low framerate, all of the native controls on the screen now behave 
</I>&gt;<i> very slowly as well, unlike in 4.0.4 where they were independent of 
</I>&gt;<i> each other.&#160; Is this intentional?
</I>
No, the runloop runs separately, in its own thread. Only the callbacks are
made on the UI thread, following the common behaviour of OpenTK and also
Android's GLSurfaceView. User code should be as efficient as possible during
these callbacks, to minimize UI delays. You can do your own background
threads for other expensive operations, if needed.

There's been a report of the run loop running slower than requested, so
there's ongoing work to make the runloop more efficient and closer to the
requested fps. There's also some technical difficulties envolved with
creating shared contexts, so we'll try to make those easier (because they're
very useful). Anything else you find that needs improving, let us know.
