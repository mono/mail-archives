I tend to get emails every so often asking about our Mono for Android book.  According to the Amazon.com web site, they have received their copies and are beginning to deliver them.  If you have had a preorder for the past 10 months, you should get your copy fairly soon.  If you are wondering about a Kindle version, I assume that is in the works, but I don't have any knowledge on that.  I would assume that other book sellers are getting their copies at this time and will soon be turning them around and shipping them out as well. I had a great group of people to work with.  They are all members of this mailing list.  Nathan Blevins, Jon Dick, John Croft, and Xamarin's own Chris Hardy.  I appreciate everything that they did as well as their patience.  I also appreciate the folks from Wrox.  Their patience and understanding can't be underestimated.  Jon Pryor and Jonathan Pobst were great and took everyone of my private emails corgially and didn't once scream at my idiocy.  Many thanks to Joseph Hill, Miguel, and Nat Friedman as well! If you haven't purchased a copy, please consider buying 8-10.  They will make great romantic gifts for that special occassion.
