The first app launch needs to load the .apk into memory, so it's not surprising that the first app launch is slower.  (It used to be much worse! [0])

Your subsequent launches are faster either because the app was only suspended and didn't exit (use the Back button to &quot;exit,&quot; while Home suspends [1]), and/or because the .apk and related data are still in the OS disk cache (and don't need to be paged in).  I'm fairly certain that there will always be some overhead in the current approach of reading the .apk header to find assemblies and mmap their contents, especially when the .apk is ~4.9MB in size (for a non-shared, linked, Hello World).

Unfortunately, I'm running out of ideas on how to drastically speed up app launch any more than we have [2, 3] , though I'm sure there are some micro-optimizations left to ferret out...

That said, &quot;proper&quot; timing would involve a linked Release build (no .mdb's increasing .apk file size) on hardware.  &quot;Hello world,&quot; first launch, is finished in 3s on my N1 (and nigh instantaneous with Back + restart).  3s is unfortunate, but it's not horribly bad either, and using a Java-based start screen would make things _seem_ faster [4]...

[1] Even the Back button may keep the OS process around, though, so that's not necessarily a real &quot;app restart&quot; either.  The only way I've found to get a &quot;fair&quot; &quot;cold start&quot; time is to (1) use the emulator (argh!), and (2) use `adb shell kill PID` to kill the process.  This still doesn't clear any OS caches that may be lying around, but at least the next app launch will need to recreate the process...

[4] For a (bad?) comparison, Firefox Beta 4 on my N1 shows a loading screen in ~0.1s, but hasn't finished loading until after 8-9s, so MonoDroid isn't spectacularly bad.  What MonoDroid needs is a decent way to show a splash screen during startup:
