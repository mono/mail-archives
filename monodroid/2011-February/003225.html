Yes...but which part of MonoDroid, OpenTK.dll or Mono.Android.dll? :-)

&gt;<i> Isn't the entire point of Mono portability?
</I>
No. The point is a nice blend between portability and support for native platform features. &quot;Write Once, Run Everywhere&quot; (WORA) is explicitly _not_ a goal, while WORA is generally considered to be a goal of Java-style portability.

Mono portability is more akin to C and C++ portability: _some_ code is sharable between platforms, and some code is platform specific, and this is a Good Thing&#8482;.

&gt;<i> This &quot;education&quot; issue fundamentally changes the behavior of the same code between different environments if I'm understanding properly.
</I>
There will aways be an education component; see also MVC design (to promote increased code sharing between platforms, otherwise you get lots of platform-specific code that still needs rewriting when moving platforms; C# is not a magical sprinkle that makes everything it touches portable, you still need to design things properly).

To circle back to the original question and comment, to which platform should Mono conform to? In the case of Point, there's the OpenTK &quot;framework&quot;, and there's the Android &quot;framework.&quot; MonoDroid's solution is to support _both_.

Thus, if you use OpenTK, System.Drawing.Point will still be a value type (struct), and you'll get ye normal by-value semantics, and (for good measure) code written against those APIs will be (somewhat) portable to other platforms (MonoTouch). This is (more or less) exactly what you're asking for.

Android.Graphics.Point, meanwhile, is the _native_ OS-level Point type. As such, it conforms to the underlying Android platform requirements, such as being a reference type. By doing so, MonoDroid promotes &quot;concept portability,&quot; so that when you see Java SDK example code using android.graphics.Point, you'll be able to translate things in a straightforward manner (and changing between reference and value semantics is not exactly straightforward) [0].

MonoDroid is _not_ &quot;fundamentally chang[ing] the behavior of the same code.&quot; Code is either written against OpenTK, in which case the semantics are _unchanged_ (System.Drawing.Point is still a value type), or code is written against Android.Graphics.Point, in which case it gets the appropriate platform semantics. It's just when intermixing the two that you need to be careful.

 - Jon

[0] OK, yes, we DO change many Android concepts in our binding which reduce &quot;concept portability,&quot; such as changing methods into properties and replacing callback interfaces with events, but in these cases we feel that sticking to .NET concepts will make things easier for .NET developers, even if it does complicate/reduce the utility of existing Java examples.
