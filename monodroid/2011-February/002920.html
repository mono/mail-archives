Welcome to my world. :-)

&gt;<i> Android (and AFAICT Java) use the same word package for two concepts. Often the apk (or jar) file is referred to as a package and individual namespaces are also referred to as packages. Android (also java) does not require that the packages (namespaces) that you put inside a package (apk or jar) file match the name of its container.
</I>
Except when it does, the original case in point being `aapt package -J`, which generates the R resource class into the package name specified within AndroidManifest.xml. Thus, they're not entirely distinct concepts, they're instead joined at the hip.

If we weren't keeping the R.java file, we wouldn't have a problem.  We are, though (so that AndroidJavaSource files can reference resources), hence the problem.

I suppose I could run replace the package name in R.java to conform with everything else...

Though now that I look at `aapt package -h` output again, i see a --custom-package flag which changes the package that R.java is inserted into.  This might be a viable solution; we lowercase the package name that R.java is inserted into (consistent with the rest of MonoDroid), and leave the AndroidManifest.xml package name unchanged.

I'll need to test this.

&gt;<i> As far as this thread and bug is concerned I'm only care about the apk package name. I could care less what namespace munging goes on to make monodroid work.
</I>
Right, but that's a pretty fundamental question: how should we support this scenario?

&gt;<i> It seems like the case that the current behavior is intended to prevent is when a programmer creates a set of classes or namespaces which create a case-folding conflict. It seems to me that instead of ToLower()ing all the names, it would be more friendly in general to just check for case-folding conflicts and creating a compilation error. This would allow for naming rules more in-line with android naming rules, while preventing case-folding violations.
</I>
That's another scenario, unfortunately I believe that will break existing projects [0], and will require IDE/tooling changes.  The problem is that the .apk package name is based on the project name, which typically follows .NET naming convention and also is the default namespace for the project.  For example, without the implicit lowercase we currently do, an (existing/new) project name of MyApp will be in a package MyApp.MyApp (Android requires a '.' in package names), which has a common prefix with the default namespace name of MyApp.  Depending on how things work out, that may or may not matter; we'd have to give more thought to it.

[0] meh; we break API constantly anyway
