Because we haven't yet optimized every part of the framework. Getting something working has been a priority over making it work well; we'll be improving things as time goes on.

&gt;<i> Hm. Why? I've already added each string into the _java_ list.
</I>
Upon further thought, you're right. My bad.

&gt;<i> &gt; Agree, but I can't imagine the model where you need this amount of grefs instantly. grefs are just links between java and mono.
</I>
It's quite easy when you have an Adapter that creates a new View instance for every GetView() invocation, instead of reusing the `convertView` parameter. ;-)

(Yes, that's  fixable, and you should be reusing the `convertView` anyway for performance reasons...)

A more plausible scenario is if you're subclassing a View in C# (e.g. a custom Button or something), and you're displaying lots of these custom types at once. Trying to show thousands at once is likely a bad UI design, but it's not entirely outside the realm of possibility...
