<PRE>Hi all,

i have written a small audio app that runs the actual mediaplayer in a
service.  This service can be started from a activity. But it keeps running
if you switch to another app. This works all just nice. But i would now like
to get some info from the service when the app / activity is started again.
But i just can't seem to get that working... 

I tried the binding samples that are online but i never get the connected
event (can't find the link right now to the sample). But it was almost the
same as this one :
<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/monodroid/2010-October/001461.html">http://lists.ximian.com/pipermail/monodroid/2010-October/001461.html</A>

Somebody said to use broadcasting, but then the service should broadcast
something periodicly. 

At first i would just like to know if the service is already running when
the app restarts / becomes active again. Stopping the service is no problem
ofcourse. In the second place i would like to communicate with the service
ofcourse. 

So binding looks to me like the option needed, but i can't seem to get it to
work. The samples in the book of Wrox don't seem to work either.
