Does this result in a call to Assembly.Load() or Assembly.LoadFrom()? The former will look within the app bundle, the latter is filled with peril.

OpenNETCF uses Assembly.LoadFrom() (doh!), but I've attached at patch [0] at the bottom of this email to fix OpenNETCF [1].

&gt;<i> The pain point right now is finding the &#8220;folder from which we are executing&#8221;.  A call to Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().CodeBase returns different things whether we&#8217;re in Debug or Release, and the Release version looks to be a hard-coded path on the machine that actually built the Mono runtime.  Another one of our devs did some chatting with Jon Pryor (thanks again Jon!) and we now understand that the answer there is &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that!&#8221;.  However, we still need this functional behavior.
</I>
Background on &quot;Don't Do That!&quot;:

	<A HREF="http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/architecture#Application_Packages">http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/architecture#Application_Packages</A>

&gt;<i>  If I include the XML file in my project, how do I &#8220;find&#8221; it and load it?  I can&#8217;t use an Asset, because the IoC library actually knows nothing about its caller, except what it can divine through Reflection or Environment calls plus I really want to keep the code base platform-agnostic.
</I>
You configure the IoC library, right? Can the configuration be platform-specific?

(Having quickly skimmed the OpenNETCF source, the only obvious configuration point I see is OpenNETCF.IoC.UI.SmartClientApplication&lt;T&gt;, which is completely inappropriate as it requires System.Windows.Forms, so I have no idea how you're configuring anything except via the DefaultModuleInfoStore default constructor.)

Assuming that it can't be platform-specific, can you configure via a Stream instead of a File? (OpenNETCF skimming: not exactly.) If it doesn't need to be an actual file, you could embed your XML file as a resource (Build action: EmbeddedResource), then use Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream() to obtain the resource contents:

	<A HREF="http://androidapi.xamarin.com/?link=M:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(string">http://androidapi.xamarin.com/?link=M:System.Reflection.Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream(string</A>)

One download of OpenNETCF and some grepping latter... 

What you could do is, instead of using the OpenNETCF.IoC.DefaultModuleInfoStore type, you'd implement your own:

	class EmbeddedResourceModuleInfoStore : IModuleInfoStore {
		public string CatalogFilePath {
			get {throw new NotSupportedException();}
			set {throw new NotSupportedException();}
		}

		public string GetModuleListXml()
		{
			using (var s = new StreamReader (
						Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly ().GetManifestResourceStream (&quot;ResourceName&quot;)))
				return s.ReadToEnd ();
		}
	}

(Then there's the minor problem of using EmbeddedResourceModuleInfoStore; the only obvious API is in SmartClientApplication, which (again) is useless. ModuleInfoStoreService.LoadModulesFromStore() is internal, so I don't see &quot;proper&quot; public API for any form of configuration...)

EmbeddedResourceModuleInfoStore isn't strictly necessary; you could instead use Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream() and write it to a file, which you then provide to the DefaultModuleInfoStore:

&gt;<i>  This is what I have so far, but as you can see, the Android stuff is just a placeholder.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>     private bool LoadConfigFromFile()
</I>&gt;<i>     {
</I>&gt;<i>         string configPath;
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>         if (Environment.OSVersion.Platform == PlatformID.Unix)
</I>
Note that PlatformID.Unix is also used for Linux and Mac OS X, so this isn't a good platform check. ;-)

&gt;<i>         {
</I>&gt;<i>             // what goes here???
</I>
	configPath = Path.Combine (
			System.Environment.GetFolderPath(System.Environment.SpecialFolder.MyDocuments),
			&quot;ProfileCatalog.xml&quot;);
	using (var o = File.OpenWrite (configPath))
	using (var i = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly ().GetManifestResourceStream (&quot;ProfileCatalog.xml&quot;))
		i.WriteTo (o);

	// configPath is /data/data/Your.Package.Name/files/ProfileCatalog.xml

The only problem with this is that the only place I see IModuleInfoStore being used is in ModuleInfoStoreService, which is (1) sealed, (2) has no useful public members, and (3) uses Assembly.LoadFrom(), not Assembly.Load() (argh!) (not to mention that ModuleInfoStoreService.LoadAssemblies() is heavily file-based).

I would thus suggest patching OpenNETCF to be sane [0].

Someone should submit [0] to the OpenNETCF folks. It shouldn't break anything upstream, and would make it actually useful on Android. :-)

&gt;<i> As a separate, but probably equally import part of this is where on earth are my app files when I install an APK anyway?
</I>
Use `adb shell pm list packages -f` to get a list of installed package names and the path of the corresponding .apk, e.g.

	$ adb shell pm list  packages -f | grep Scratch
	package:/data/app/Scratch.AssemblyLoad-1.apk=Scratch.AssemblyLoad

Thus, my Scratch.AssemblyLoad app is in the file /data/app/Scratch.AssemblyLoad-1.apk.

&gt;<i> I get the feeling they remain in the APK and are squirreled away somewhere on the device.  Is there any documentation online about the actual application and assembly startup/load process?
</I>
If the above Architecture page doesn't answer your question, let me know so that I can clarify the documentation. :-)

[1] I've only spent 10 minutes reading the source to OpenNETCF, but for an IoC library I'd expect it to have more ways to control what it's doing...
