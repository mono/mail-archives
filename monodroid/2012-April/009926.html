I see that there are a number of controls in the toolbox in the designer in VS.  Questions:Are the controls filtered in anyway?  For example, is there a way to only show controls that are suitable for Honeycomb and later?  I see that there is a place where I select which standard look to give the controls in the designer (ICS, Honeycomb, Gingerbread, Froyo, ....).  Can that be used in anyway to filter these controls somehow?  I tried to change the Android version level settings in the project properties and the android manifest file, closed and reloaded the solution, and I found that the toolbox didn't change the controls inside of it.I am guessing that the controls that are loaded are based on a defined set of controls somewhere.  There are some that are missing.  Is there anyway to add to the controls displayed in the toolbox?  I did a right click on the toolbox and tried to &quot;chose items&quot; but did not see anything besides the standard .NET items.  Is a way coming to add controls to the toolbox?I haven't tried this, but what happens if I have a control that isn't listed in the toolbox that I use in a layout? Wally
