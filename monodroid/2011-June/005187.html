<PRE>Hi all, I asked this in the forum but didn't get any replies. Not sure if it was because no one knows or if you guys didn't get the email. Sorry for the re-post if you did get it the first time.

Anyway, has anybody successfully connected to a Webservice from Mono for Android using Windows Authentication? I can connect if Anonymous is enabled but as soon as I select Windows and give the service proxy the credentials it comes back with a 401 error. This is the code:
 
                TestService.Service1 ts = new TestService.Service1(); 
                CredentialCache cache = new CredentialCache(); 
                cache.Add(new Uri(ts.Url), &quot;Negotiate&quot;, new NetworkCredential(&quot;username&quot;, &quot;pasword&quot;));
                 ts.Credentials = cache; 
                ts.PreAuthenticate = true; 
                identity.Text = ts.WhoAmI(); 

This code works perfectly from a Windows form test project so I know the webservice itself is ok. I'm using the emulator and have changed the URL to use the IP address of the host rather than &quot;local&quot;, I have also tried &quot;NTLM&quot; instead of &quot;Negotiate&quot;.
 
Thanks in advance for any help. 

Regards 
Brian
