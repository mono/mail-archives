<PRE>Hi everyone

I have created my first Android application as part of studying for my 
degree. I was required to do a project for a real client. The company 
who I am doing my project for wanted me to do an Android application. 
Because the company is .Net based they decided to go the MonoDroid/Touch 
route.

The application is called &quot;Crash&quot; and is used to gather information when 
you have a motor vehicle accident so that you have accurate information 
on hand when you need to make insurance claims.

I am required to get some users to test the application (at least 5) and 
fill out a feedback form. The feedback form is small. Should only take 2 
mins to fill out.

The application can only be used on phones running Android version 2.2 
and up.

I don't know many people with Android phones so I thought that I would 
try here to get some users to test my app. If anyone is interested in 
trying out my app and wouldn't mind giving some feedback it would be a 
great help.

The application can be downloaded from the market either by searching 
for &quot;Techcertain&quot; or by going to this link 
<A HREF="https://market.android.com/details?id=crash.crashapp">https://market.android.com/details?id=crash.crashapp</A>

The link for the feedback form is

I am also working on a user manual which can be downloaded from here
