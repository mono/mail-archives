<PRE>I agree with Miguel it would take a mamouth effort to get WPF on mono
despite how nice it might be to have and without the funding it
probably wont happen.

I to am a WPF developer, however there are ways around this issue. My
company recently released a product that uses Moonlight in its Desktop
mode (using the MoonlightHost control for GTK) to run a WPF based
application on ubuntu. The great part is that the project will cross
compile under windows using WPF, If you are careful about only using
stuff that Silverlight 3/4 supports you can write applications that
will work in both WPF and Moonlight on the desktop. I am planning to
blog on how to do that at some point (if there is enough interest, I
was also thinking about submitting a proposal to present the technique
at monospace..)

I think what I am getting at is that mono does not really need to
implement WPF, we just need to get a bit more creative with Moonlight
:<i>)
