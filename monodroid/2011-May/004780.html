Uh, wow.

I don't see an NRE, but I do see the build failing with no actually useful output.

TL;DR: This isn't going to work without lots of pain.

The Java support in Mono for Android was intended primarily for &quot;glue&quot; scenarios. It could be (ab)used to include an entire Java project, as you appear to be doing, but the intention was that any Java used with a Mono for Android project would, to a large extent, be specific to that project.

Bearing that in mind, let's follow along. :-)

To see what's going wrong, use a terminal. I'm using `xbuild` here, but MSBuild can be used on Windows:

	$ cd path/to/your/project
	$ xbuild /t:Install *.csproj /p:MandroidExtraArgs=-v=10

The /p:MandroidExtraArgs=-v=10 tells mandroid to (1) spit out more debugging information, and (2) to preserve any temporary files that would normally be deleted. When executed, there's a line similar to:

	Running command: /usr/bin/javac &quot;-d&quot; &quot;bin/classes&quot; &quot;-classpath&quot; 
	&quot;/Users/jon/Development/Projects/Scratch.ZX/Scratch.ZX/obj/Debug/android/bin/mono.android.jar&quot;
	&quot;-bootclasspath&quot;
	&quot;/Users/jon/Development/mono-droid/android-sdk-mac_x86/platforms/android-4/android.jar&quot;
	&quot;-encoding&quot; &quot;UTF-8&quot;
	&quot;@/var/folders/1v/1vb8D51NH68vFX-QKsi00++++TI/-Tmp-/tmp7ca7858d.tmp&quot;

(Note the /var/folders/... reference; this is a temporary file which is _normally_ removed.)

Thus, run the command in Terminal:

	$ cd obj/Debug/android
	$ /usr/bin/javac &quot;-d&quot; # copy &amp; paste above command...

This provides some useful output:

	/Users/jon/Development/Projects/Scratch.ZX/Scratch.ZX/android/src/com/google/zxing/client/android/result/CalendarResultHandler.java:46: cannot find symbol
	symbol  : class ParsedResult
	location: class com.google.zxing.client.android.result.CalendarResultHandler
	  public CalendarResultHandler(Activity activity, ParsedResult result) {

It doesn't like ParsedResult, as it doesn't have a definition. Fair enough -- you only included the sources for `android`, not `core`.

Two ways we could go here:

  (1) Include all the `core` sources into the solution
  (2) Build core.jar (`ant -f core` in the xzing-1.6 directory), then copy core.jar into your project and set it's Build action as AndroidJavaSource.

I tried (1), though (2) should work.

The result of including all `core` sources into the project?

	/Users/jon/Development/Projects/Scratch.ZX/Scratch.ZX/android/src/com/google/zxing/client/android/CaptureActivityHandler.java:99: package R does not exist
	      case R.id.launch_product_query:

Hm. CaptureActivityHandler.java wants to use the aapt-generated R type, but assumes that R is in the same package as CaptureActivityHandler -- com.google.zxing.client.android. Instead, the R.java we're generating is in scratch.xz (for my project; ymmv). Oops.

Furthermore, we're not including any of the resources. Double oops.

So I take a step back; can I build the `android` app and get a .jar that I can include?

	$ cd zxing-1.6/android
	$ ant
	...
	[aapt] /Users/jon/Downloads/zxing-1.6/android/res/values/strings.xml:96: error: Multiple substitutions specified in non-positional formaapt: warning: string 'preferences_custom_product_search_title' has no default translation in /Users/jon/Downloads/zxing-1.6/andat; did you mean to add the formatted=&quot;false&quot; attribute?

So I can't even build the Android sample anyway, because my `aapt` doesn't like their resources; strings.xml:96 is:

	&lt;string name=&quot;preferences_custom_product_search_summary&quot;&gt;Use %s as a placeholder for the product ID, and %f for format&lt;/string&gt;

Apparently `aapt` doesn't like the %s and %f in there. :-(

At this point, I'm calling it quits. In an ideal world, you could (somehow?) build the zxing android project into a &quot;library .jar&quot;, then include that library .jar into your Mono for Android project, and everything would work. (However, there are some limitations with library projects, most of which I forget atm, and I don't know how easy it would be to turn zxing/android into a library project.) As is, though, you're looking, minimum, at copying zxing/android/res/** into your Resources directory (plus Build action of AndroidResource), then changing ~every android/**/*.java file to use your.project.package.R instead of com.google.zxing.client.android.R.

Is this doable? Certainly.

Is it simple and quick? No.
