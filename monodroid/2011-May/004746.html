<PRE>+1  Another HUGE thanks to the entire MONO team for your creativity,
dedication, support and extremely cool personalities!!!! :)

 

Also, thanks Miguel for dismissing some of the incorrect statements that
have been made.it was needed.

 

Looking forward to MonoSpace 2011!

Subject: [mono-android] thanks to the MT/MD teams

 

So, I think this is probably implied from the chatter on the lists, but I
don't think it would hurt to say it explicitly:

 

Big, huge, ginormous THANKS to the guys on the MT and MD teams for all the
work they've done to create these great products.  

 

I think we all know that they are in no way responsible for the FUD of the
past few days, and if anything it's probably driving them crazy that they're
not allowed to say more than they have.  Being at the center of this kind of
turmoil is no fun, having your job security be in doubt is no fun, and
watching the community that you obviously have poured a lot of your heart
into get treated this way is no fun.

 

No matter what happens, we appreciate what you've accomplished, and we hope
everything turns out the best for you and all of us.  I hope your new bosses
realize what a great team and great products they have, and make some brave,
bold choices about their future.

 

in closing, 

 

&quot;I for one welcome our new insect overlords&quot;
