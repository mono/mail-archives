<PRE>I don&#8217;t like forums.. The simple fact one has to set up accounts for each one is annoying.
The fix is quite simple; make the archive public.
Don&#8217;t see much cause for keeping it private..

Once opened up, then anyone could find information using google.

I had the same problem for at group where I was installing a forum for. They was also using email. The solution was that they use the forum, but all posts are sent to the members on email.

A forum is a very importent &quot;backup&quot; and also for newcomers who hasn't been a member on the list.

I could with pleasure install a forum on one of my servers to support the community.

I live on email.  If an email doesn't come to me, its worthless because I don't know to act on it.  Moving this to another forum that I have to go search on essentially removes me from the list.  As such, I don't want to see this mailing list shutdown.  I understand the pain and it would definitely be nice if there was a search function against the email list repository.

Personally, I put all of my list emails like this one in a folder.  I can search on the folder.  Obviously, that doesn't help someone that is new to the list.

If someone would like to build that search engine, I would be glad to send them all of the emails that I have from the mono-android and monotouch lists to that project.

Subject: [mono-android] Wish this list had used a forum or Stackoverflow

There is so much useful info in this list digest but not accessible because there&#8217;s no search feature on the site.  This wealth of knowledge is essentially lost.  I&#8217;d like to suggest this list be shut down and move further discussions to stackoverflow or a forum so it is searchable, indexed, etc.  This system is great for today but for those of us just getting started we have no data bank to search with ease.
