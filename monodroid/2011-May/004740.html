&gt;<i> heck - maybe they're going to sell mono
</I>

I don't have any understanding beyond what has been speculated in the blog
posts and articles referenced and linked to in this thread as to how
Attachmate views Mono in regards their future. But I really don't think it
matters all that much either.  The Mono Project began as an open source
project funded by an open source company (Ximian) which was doing well
enough for Novell to feel justified in in acquisition in 2003. Okay, fair
enough, Novell would have been far better off staying away from the
acquisitions game altogether, though it would be tough to argue that the
likes of SUSE and Ximian didn't fit well within their technological domain
whereas quite obviously the likes of Wordperfect most certainly did not.

Regardless, while I commend Novell for investing resources into Mono over
the years, it's tough to argue that the funding  of a ~30 person team by a
multi-billion dollar corporation represented anything more than a passing
interest in what the Mono Project team members were doing and what that
could mean to Novell's bottom line. Of course that didn't stop them from
cashing the 300+ million USD check(s) given to them by Microsoft something
that would have never happened had it not been for the work Miguel and the
rest of the Mono crew put in over the years into developing the source code
foundation that became the base for bringing Silverlight to Linux in record
time and the personal relationships with key MSFT decision makers in whom
had developed a level of trust with Miguel and his team in regards to their
ability to deliver production ready code as promised. Which, of course, they
did, and have continued to do which brings me to my first significant point:

* A check from Microsoft for 300+ million USD isn't something that comes
without care or concern as to what they're going to get in return.  I have
absolutely no idea what, if anything, is still required of Novell -- and
subsequently Attachmate -- to deliver on and/or continue to support as it
relates to their original agreement, but I do believe the idea that
Attachmate could very well still be contractually obligated to deliver
Mono-based product and/or support for many years to come which would, of
course, require an engineering base skilled in the areas covered by that
agreement.

Setting aside the likely fact that Attachmate couldn't dismiss the Mono
Project team members even if they wanted to, while Mono has certainly been
capable of generating revenue year-after-year with support and licensing
contracts and. more recently, the development and licensing of development
tools and runtimes, just as Microsoft's annual revenue pales in comparison
the amount of revenue collectively generated by the ISV ecosystem in which
they enable so does any platform and tools companies revenue stream in
comparison to the underlying ecosystem in which they enable.

While this &gt; <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Companies_Using_Mono">http://www.mono-project.com/Companies_Using_Mono</A> &lt; list
represents a mere fraction of the total list of companies in whom rely on
Mono in one form or another to make possible their existence in their chosen
market and technology space. That said, even if this same list was
comprehensive, at quick glance I can see at least five companies in which
have built multi-million dollar revenue streams on top of the Mono Project
code base which leads me to my second significant point:

* If it turns out that the Mono Project team members are, in fact,
&quot;disposable&quot; as far as Attachmate's legal obligations are concerned, the
open market value that the team represents goes well beyond what could
simply be ignored as &quot;chump change&quot; by any self-respecting, non-suicidal
executive. If Attachmate doesn't see business reason nor justification for a
long term commitment to Mono  they'll most certainly see the value in
finding the highest bidding corporation that does.

Pushing past even this not-too-unlikely scenario, the last and potentially
most significant point that needs to be brought to the surface is the
significant amount of resources -- both human and cold hard cash -- that
both has and continues to be put into the development and support of
&lt;del&gt;The Codeplex Foundation[1]&lt;/del&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Outercurve Foundation[2]&lt;/ins&gt; by
a significant base of multi-million and multi-billion dollar corporations, a
foundation who's stated mission is:

The mission of the Outercurve Foundation is to enable the exchange of code
&gt;<i> and understanding among software companies and open source communities. In
</I>&gt;<i> practice this means providing software IP management and project development
</I>&gt;<i> governance to enable and encourage organizations to develop software
</I>&gt;<i> collaboratively in open source communities for faster results.
</I>

It's by no strange coincidence that amongst the highly prestigious names
found amongst the Board of Directors, Foundation Staff, and Advisory Board
is one Miguel de Icaza:
<A HREF="http://www.outercurve.org/About/BoardofDirectors.aspx">http://www.outercurve.org/About/BoardofDirectors.aspx</A> &lt; has got to represent
at least something of significance as far as the ability for the Mono
Project to find a well funded new home if it turns out the first two points
prove unable to hold water.

If I can summarize: Please take a deep breath and breathe easy in the
knowledge that the Mono Project is in absolutely no danger of going away. In
fact, if anything, you're far more likely to see an expansion of the current
~30-person team, even if that expansion  comes in the form of smaller
sub-teams being funded by the vast expanse of corporations who generate far
too much revenue due to the existence of the Mono Project to simply just
look the other way.  I hate this phrase just as much, if not more than many
of you likely will, but the Mono Project is simply too damn big too fail.
