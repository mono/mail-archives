<PRE>Wally,

Sorry to hear that your efforts have been disrupted. I can understand that
you would not want to release the book into such uncertainty and that your
audience is not going to be clamouring like it was before.

I think you CAN guess when it would be sensible to return though. Miguel has
stated that he expects new products to be in beta in 3-4 months with .NET
for Android trailing .NET for iOS by about a month. As an author, I am
pretty sure that Xamarin will be willing to give you pretty solid
information on the timeline as those dates grow closer.

So, I guess it depends on where in the life cycle of the new product you
want to launch a book. Do you want to be there when the product launches? Do
you want to gauge it's popularity first? Do you want to wait until it
matures a bit?

It is a lot harder for me to guess when you will release your book than it
is for me to guess when .NET for Android will be available.

I admit though that these are just guesses. There are a lot of variables
that could impact things between now and then.

&gt;<i>  Just to let everyone know, the book is on hold.  It went on hold Friday
</I>&gt;<i> night.  All of my coauthors know it is on hold.  Apologies, but we can't
</I>&gt;<i> share any documents or code.  My guess from the Miguel blog post is that it
</I>&gt;<i> will return in the future.  With no product to work from and no apparent
</I>&gt;<i> support from Attachmate, we can't guess when it will return.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure how amazon charges on this, but I bet you could take it off of
</I>&gt;<i> preorder.  [image: Sad smile]

</I>&gt;<i> OUCH!
</I>&gt;<i> How will this impact on the Wrox book to be released, I've pre-ordered with
</I>&gt;<i> Amazon?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Professional Android Programming with Mono for Android and .NET/C#*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been waiting for this and spending many hours dedicated to Monodroid..
</I>&gt;<i> loosing start up companies in this process is really unfair.
</I>&gt;<i> Very disjointed takeover from Attach&#233; Mate, many people negatively impacted.
</I>&gt;<i> :(
