<PRE>So, first of all, I still have not heard back from support (not really 
surprising, in light of the acquisition) regarding the fact that the 
&quot;Activate&quot; button doesn't work in MonoDevelop on Windows.

So I have switched over to my Mac in hopes of being able to get some 
work done while I wait for a solution. But now I am having a problem on 
OSX as well!

My devices, both emulator and physical, seem to appear in adb just fine. 
And I can even use adb to install .apk files that were built with Mono 
for Android.

But when I go to deploy to a device in MonoDevelop, I see my emulator 
device listed as &quot;not started&quot; in the &quot;Select Device&quot; dialog, and 
nothing else. My physical device never appears.

I can successfully start the emulator device by clicking &quot;Start 
Emulator&quot;, but it never changes from &quot;not started&quot; in that dialog. 
Clicking &quot;Create Emulator&quot; brings up the the AVD manager as expected. 
Clicking &quot;Refresh&quot; grays out the refresh button and seemingly does 
nothing else.

The &quot;OK&quot; button stays grayed-out the entire time.

This is extremely frustrating, as it makes Mono for Android almost 
unusable for me.

Does anyone have any ideas? Where does the &quot;Select Device&quot; dialog get 
its information from?


Andrew
