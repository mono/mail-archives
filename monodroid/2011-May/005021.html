I definitely think that we all feel &quot;betrayed&quot; by the these events.  Whether or not fraud has been committed is for a court of law to decide.  Lets not let our frustration get the best of us.
I would suggest that someone with contacts initiate a dialogue with Attachmate and and ask for a statement of direction with regards to Monotouch and mono for android.  What are the plans with regards to honoring their statements regarding roadmaps remaining intact, technologies in general, problems in the mono for android stack, and such.

Well I don't expect waiting for answers on this mailing list is going to provide a very eventful outcome.I haven't seen an official Attachmate employee post to this group ever since I heard of the rumour that they laid off the entire MT team.


We need to open a dialogue with Attachmate on this issue and get a formal statement of how existing customers are meant to proceed on MonoTouch/MonoDroid technologies.Anyone got any ideas on how to do this?

I didn't say that Attachment doesn't suck and the product has a dead future.

NokNok is talking about law suits and fraud. Attachment doesn't have to fix any bugs, they don't have to answer out emails and they don't have to care. Nothing in any agreement with Novell said anything about any of that. We purchased a product that works. I have apps in the app store made with it so no one can say it isn't as advertised. Any technically for the time being it still is. I wouldn't buy it. I would tell anyone else in the world not to. But for those of us that did it just sucks. There is nothing that can be done YET. They haven't done anything illegal YET. Wrong, definitely. Immoral, sure. But nothing illegal or actionable has been done as far as myself or my lawyer see it.

Which is a very real problem if they're still selling it given that..


 
 They just got rid of the team. 



Just? the reason why you would choose to develop software on a platform is that it remains a well-supported option






They haven't said they won't get a new team. 



How can they possibly get a new team? all their expertise on the product has now vanished. This is not a drop-in tech for .NET devs on the street to fill. No Mono team means MonoTouch/MonoDroid will never be properly supported






Also, their product still works.


Where do we file bugs? and who will resolve them?

I still disagree. That analogy makes no sense. Your car will definitely need oil changes. Updating the product that they create is up to their discretion. Also, the easy fix in your scenario would be to pay for your oil change elsewhere. This also can't be done with the product we are talking about without further agreement which may be in the works for all we know.





It doesn't guarantee the release of updates, it guarantees that we will have access to any that come out.

    I dont know about that.  If Im a consumer, looking to build .NET
    apps on MonoDroid, and I purchased MonoDroid last week, my
    expectation from the site is that I am paying for a product which
    includes 1 year of updates.

    

    If in fact, their is no-one to make such updates, nor is their &quot;an
    intent&quot; to provide updates over the year, then that my friend is
    fraud.

    

    So if they do not establish they HAVE intent, then in fact it would
    be like me selling  you my car, with a year free oil changes, but I
    have no place to do the oil changes, i have no employees to do the
    oil changes, i have no intention of ever giving you an oil change.

      They def haven't committed any fraud yet.

      

      I'm just as angry as the rest of you, I am just pointing out that
      all the conclusions that are being jumped to (that Attachment owes
      us something or fraud) just aren't true yet. They say we are
      entitled to any updates that come out for a year. The only way
      there is any fraud related to that is if an update does come out
      that is denied to us. They aren't guaranteeing that they will ever
      come out with an update. The discount code works, no fraud there.
      The product has not been officially killed for all we know they
      are hiring new people to take the product in a new direction. I
      doubt that's the case and wouldn't support them if they did, but
      since we can't prove any of this none of the below statement is
      true at this point.

                                standpoint if monotouch doesn't come
                                with guaranteed support why should they
                                be obligated to do so? Esspecially since
                                we agreed that they don't in the
                                contract. I know that you can't have a
                                contract that negates a law but there is
                                no law that says a company must provide
                                user support.

                                

                                That being said I'm from the U.S. so I

                                country. I just know my lawyer pointed
                                out that clause in 10 minutes and asked
                                me about promised support.
