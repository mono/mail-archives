One would expect a company to act in a normal and logical way.  Unfortunately, companies, especially those in the technology area, tend to be driven by ego.  This could be ego to keep Miguel from succeeding, ego to take money from him after it ships, and any number of reasons.  Given that attachmate apparently fired these people with little to no advanced warning, it would seem that attachmate would not be driven by a logical approach.  Of course, we don't know what is driving attachmate.  All we can do is speculate at this time, but dang, it definitely doesn't look very logical at this time.  My guess is that there are the following reasons:Attachmate bought Novell, looked at the finances over the course of a year or more, saw that the mono team was not a money maker and said &quot;You're Fired.&quot;  Of course, that doesn't look at what is happening over the course of the last few months with the release of MonoTouch and Mono for Android.  Probably highly likely.Attachmate looked at Mono and said, &quot;You guys aren't very big, You're Fired.&quot;  Maybe/maybe not.Attachmate had some super secret deal with some company that infused a lot of money due based on patents and IP and firing the mono guys was part of the deal.  High unlikely, but still, who doesn't like a good conspiracy theory.
Now how do you convince a court of law made of people that have no understanding of code that you didn't take a copy of product X from your previous employer, take it to your new employer, and not just copy-n-paste to create new product Y which magically copies all of the functionality of the product X right down to the API calls.  The fact that we as developers know that the API calls come from iOS has little bearing on anything.  I hope that Miguel and company can pull this off, but danged, it just sounds so daunting when I say it to myself.
IANAL, so does the fact that Attachmate has abandonded its customers provide any ground for Miguel and Co. to go forward?  I wouldn't think so, but danged if I know.  Any ideas?

if Attachmate abandons their product (and it's revenue potential) and refuses to support customers who have legitimate, paid licenses for the product, why would they waste money chasing Miguel's team in court?

the fact that Miguel expects to spend 3 months getting to an initial release seems like a pretty good indication that he is seriously starting from scratch, not using any of the existing MT IP

granted, Attachmate's behavior so far doesn't seem entirely rational, and many companies seem more than happy to waste money on legal actions that do nothing but generate bad press for them
 I am also really concerned about the legal ramifications of this.  I just don't see how Miguel and company don't get tied up in the courts on this one.
