<PRE>I think it is a good idea to install a forum - mailing lists like this one
spams my mail account with tons of messages in an unsorted way. It is
difficult to follow one discussion...

We dont need a forum. It exists all-ready.

What we write here is tracked by the forum

I don't like forums.. The simple fact one has to set up accounts for each
one is annoying.

The fix is quite simple; make the archive public.

Don't see much cause for keeping it private..

 

Once opened up, then anyone could find information using google.

I had the same problem for at group where I was installing a forum for. They
was also using email. The solution was that they use the forum, but all
posts are sent to the members on email.

A forum is a very importent &quot;backup&quot; and also for newcomers who hasn't been
a member on the list.

I could with pleasure install a forum on one of my servers to support the
community.

I live on email.  If an email doesn't come to me, its worthless because I
don't know to act on it.  Moving this to another forum that I have to go
search on essentially removes me from the list.  As such, I don't want to
see this mailing list shutdown.  I understand the pain and it would
definitely be nice if there was a search function against the email list
repository.

 

Personally, I put all of my list emails like this one in a folder.  I can
search on the folder.  Obviously, that doesn't help someone that is new to
the list.  

 

If someone would like to build that search engine, I would be glad to send
them all of the emails that I have from the mono-android and monotouch lists
to that project.

Subject: [mono-android] Wish this list had used a forum or Stackoverflow

There is so much useful info in this list digest but not accessible because
there's no search feature on the site.  This wealth of knowledge is
essentially lost.  I'd like to suggest this list be shut down and move
further discussions to stackoverflow or a forum so it is searchable,
indexed, etc.  This system is great for today but for those of us just
getting started we have no data bank to search with ease.
