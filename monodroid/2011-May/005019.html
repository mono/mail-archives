<PRE>I am not sure why there would be any court action. I am also not sure
Xamarin is starting completely from scratch. It would be interesting to
know. I know the MonoTouch stuff a bit better so I will use that as
examples.

First, Attachmate is the one that terminated their employment (without
cause). They have a very weakened position in that event in terms of what
means the ex-Novell team chooses to pursue for their income. The team is
allowed to use their knowledge and skills as long as they do not use
proprietary code. I am sure that part of what makes Xamarin possible is that
pretty much all their employees are probably on severance pay from Novell. I
would not be surprised if many of them are still getting Novell paychecks
when .NET for iOS is released.

Second, a fair bit of what Xamarin needs to create .NET for iOS may have
been released by Novell under MIT/X11 licenses. This code can be used by
anyone to create commercial products without fear of lawsuits. Not only was
a lot of the core Mono functionality (full AOT compilation for example)
driven by the needs of MonoTouch but some of the code is common between
MonoMac and MonoTouch. I see no reason why the MacCore stuff on GitHub could
not be used in Xamarin product for example.

Third, Xamarin can use the MonoTouch API wholesale. There is a tonne of
legal precedent around this.

Fourth, it seems unlikely that Attachmate owns any patents that we need to
worry about. The Microsoft patents are as before (and largely covered off by
the Microsoft Community Promise). Most of the previous Novell patents have
been sold and will now find themselves under the Open Invention Network.

Fifth, I read recently (and Miguel confirmed via Twitter) that Android 3.1
is actually shipping out-of-the-box with the Mono runtime. I am not sure if
that will/can continue now but, if so, that could really give the Xamarin
team a leg up on Android.

If you look at the commits in the public GItHub Mono repository you will see
that many of the check-ins relate to MonoDroid (Mono for Android) and
MonoTouch. My read is the team invested a lot work while at Novell that is
now available to them via GitHub and that will speed up their efforts.

After all, Miguel is suggesting 3-4 months before we see a preview of the
Xamarin products. That is a pretty aggressive timeline. I suspect that the
reason these timelines may be realistic is precisely because they are not
starting from scratch.

Other companies that rely on Mono for their own mobile solutions (Unity?)
will probably help with the effort. A lot of the testing, polishing, and bug
fixing may be contributed by non-Xamarin partners once preview code starts
to show-up. This does not really address the &quot;from scratch&quot; question I
realize.

Attachmate has sent a pretty clear signal that they just do not care about
Mono. This is not surprising for a company that appears to make it's money
by miking mature technologies. SUSE is already a stretch for them. The kind
of business that Mono represents is just off their radar. It is also
possible that they wanted to send a clear signal that SUSE is now pure Linux
and not a Microsoft lackey like some in the Linux world have tried to
portray Novell. How much money should Attachmate rationally spend going
after a Mono start-up? I think they are looking to minimize costs. Legal
fights do not really do that.

It is interesting though that Attachmate is still selling the Mono products
and that it has said that the Mono business is now in the hands of the SUSE
management. Time will tell what their plans are there. I am not so naive
that I think legal action is impossible. It just looks so ill advised that I
have trouble understanding what kind of management would attempt it. Then
again, we have seem stupid stuff before.
