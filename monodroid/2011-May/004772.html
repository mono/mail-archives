<PRE>&gt;<i> Miguel has stated pretty flatly that WPF is an unlikely development for
</I>&gt;<i> Mono. I think somebody else would really need to step-up for that or else
</I>&gt;<i> somebody would have to come with a good business case to convince Miguel's
</I>&gt;<i> team to make it a priority
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is something that I would like to see very much and would in fact
dedicate time to start such a project if there were others that might be
interested in helping out.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given the resources such an effort would likely pull away from other
</I>&gt;<i> things, I kind of wish that it does not happen myself. That said, it would
</I>&gt;<i> be nice if WPF was not the standard example given in every Internet forum
</I>&gt;<i> for proving that Mono is either not useful and/or hopelessly behind .NET in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of currency and maturity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I have seen this before and although I am new to mono, specifically
monodroid, I think it could be a great way to attract more people to check
out Linux for desktop development. WPF has changed the way that desktop apps
are written on Windows, I'd never go back to WinForms.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am seeing less and less evidence that Mono is in trouble. Miguel's
</I>&gt;<i> messages have implied that a bit more patience and a bit less hysteria are
</I>&gt;<i> in order. Members of the Novell Mono team have continued to post commits to
</I>&gt;<i> Git and responses to the mailing lists. The tone of all of these imply to me
</I>&gt;<i> that they do not expect the projects to suddenly come to a halt. Not one
</I>&gt;<i> Novell employee has broken from the ranks to raise the alarm on the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;anonymous&quot; Internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agree, we just got Mono For Android this week and have started developing
</I>apps with it and we don't plan on stopping unless some big news comes down.
For now the site is up, the road map is there and they accepted the credit
card when we paid!
