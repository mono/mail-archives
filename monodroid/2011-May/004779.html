Perhaps you should post something to the general Mono mailing list to gauge
the level of interest. We should not clutter up the MonoDroid list with it
anymore than we have.

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I have seen this before and although I am new to mono, specifically
</I>&gt;<i> monodroid, I think it could be a great way to attract more people to check

</I>&gt;<i> are written on Windows, I'd never go back to WinForms.
</I>&gt;<i>

It would be a pretty major undertaking but, as you say, perhaps this would
attract some new .NET blood to the Mono camp from the Windows world. That
could only be a good thing. The work already done with XAML and Silverlight
(Moonlight)

Have you tried GTK# at all? Given that this is the MonoDroid list, I guess I
am not looking for a response. Also, I know that GTK# is not WPF. It is
certainly a big step up from WinForms though.


&gt;&gt;<i> I am seeing less and less evidence that Mono is in trouble. Miguel's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> messages have implied that a bit more patience and a bit less hysteria are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in order. Members of the Novell Mono team have continued to post commits to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Git and responses to the mailing lists. The tone of all of these imply to me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that they do not expect the projects to suddenly come to a halt. Not one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Novell employee has broken from the ranks to raise the alarm on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;anonymous&quot; Internet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agree, we just got Mono For Android this week and have started developing
</I>&gt;<i> apps with it and we don't plan on stopping unless some big news comes down.
</I>&gt;<i> For now the site is up, the road map is there and they accepted the credit
</I>&gt;<i> card when we paid!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good luck with your development.
