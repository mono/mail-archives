<PRE>I think their story would hold up well in court (though of course I'm not at
all a lawyer):

   1. It bodes well for them that they were 'fired', and not that they broke
   off to form an existing company, driven by profit motivation.
   2. They developed the original product, of course they are familiar with
   the API's, which are publicly available.  Just because they are targeting a
   compatible API does not indicate they copied code.  The API's are more like
   an interface, but that doesn't mean things under the hood are identical.
   3. They could break out their code and compare it to the Attachmate code
   in court.  These guys are familiar with not using existing source to code
   their implementations, so I suspect they are diligent here to code it 'from
   scratch' and make sure it's not a copy of any Attachmate code.  Nothing new
   here.
   4. They are trying to acquire the products from Attachmate.  This shows
   an effort to avoid simply 'copying' the products.  If attachmate would be
   willing to move quicker here, they wouldn't have to code it again from
   scratch.


I am starting to feel better about this all.  We can't say for sure what
Attachmate has planned, but I'm going to keep thinking best case scenario,
which is we have hit a small setback, but in the long run we'll end up
bigger, stronger, faster!
