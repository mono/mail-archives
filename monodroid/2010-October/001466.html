In this case, you can actually get it working, you just need to jump
through some hoops:

 1. There's currently no attribute support for anything other than 
    Activities, so you'll have to hand-write the XML in 
    Properties\AndroidManifest.xml to add the services/etc.

 2. Only Activity.onCreate() will actually load and initialize the
    runtime, so if you're trying to use something that isn't a service
    you'll need to (somehow) ensure that the Activity is run first
    so that the runtime is usable, otherwise you'll get errors
    about missing native methods when you try to do ~anything
    with the Service/etc.

(1) should be straightforward enough.  (2) may be more problematic, as I
haven't explored it, though launching the service from within an
activity will *probably* Just Work if (1) is done.  (Fingers crossed.)
