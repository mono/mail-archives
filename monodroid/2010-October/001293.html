<PRE>Honestly, for me personally, the best API decision would be to have all the places that need Java.Lang.Object just take a System.Object instead, but I have no visibility into how the runtime and interop works, so I don't know if that's even possible.

More specifically, I don't know how the JLO is used under the hood. I don't know it's behavior in this particular instance, and I don't know what a JLO really is.  I haven't really even looked at the JLO definition. I'll do that and think about potential API solutions.

Well, in my case, I'm creating a ListViewItemAdapterBase class that has the following:
        public IList&lt;T&gt; Items
        {
            get { return this._items; }
            set { this._items = value; }
        }
        protected IList&lt;T&gt; _items = new List&lt;T&gt;();

It then returns Count, and GetItem based on the Ilist interface. It also returns ID because I have a base item class that has ID in the interface.

&gt;<i>From there, I'm creating a bunch of different adapters that simply override the GetView method to customize the view items. That way I can have complete control over the display of list items, but I only have to override one method.
</I>
Right now as a workaround I have my domain objects inherit from Java.Lang.Object, but that's not a very good model, as it's not portable. I'd prefer to have client agnostic classes, but as soon as I have them inherit from Java.Lang.Object, that's no longer possible.

Honestly, for me personally, the best API decision would be to have all the places that need Java.Lang.Object just take a System.Object instead, but I have no visibility into how the runtime and interop works, so I don't know if that's even possible.

The Adapter types do expose a bunch of them.  How would an
arbitrary .net type be used in a BaseAdapter subclass?  Does it rely on
ToString() for rendering in the AdapterView?

A while back, I considered adding a mechanism for automatically
converting any arbitrary object to a java object and back, but it is not
clear to me that it would be a good thing.  If the java object has to be
able to do things like reliably forward ToString calls to the wrapped
object, that makes it more interesting, with more overhead.

getClass would be garbage to any java code.  clone would be unreliable
for arbitrary objects.  equals, hashcode, toString are all doable.
Even if the only thing that has to work properly is wrapping and
unwrapping a reference when invoking and returning, that's overhead that
doesn't exist if you derive from JLO.

So JLO isn't quite as evil as it might seem.  :-)
