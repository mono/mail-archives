        The intention of this is to give us a chance to fix bugs and
        address
        problems before MonoDroid goes public.
        
        If folks were to do a public review of MonoDroid based on its
        current preview-status, it would not look very good, and it
        would hurt MonoDroid's reception based on a product that we knew
        was incomplete.
        
        In general, we have no problems with developers showing what
        they are doing, showing it to co-workers or even blogging about
        it when you guys are showcasing the good points.
        
        For the bad parts, we basically want to have a chance to fix the
        problems before MonoDroid becomes a public product....
        
        Once we go public, if we have a bad product, it is fair game to
        lambast us in public as much as you want.   But right now, we
        did not even consider this a beta, since we are not even
        feature-complete, this is a preview of what the product will
        look like.


<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/private/monodroid/2010-August/000123.html">http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/private/monodroid/2010-August/000123.html</A>

        &gt; Well, I do not feel that MonoDroid is ready for a public
        review,
        &gt; which is why this is a closed preview, not a public beta.
        &gt;
        &gt; We would hate a UG introduction to turn into &quot;Well, that thing is not good
        &gt; at all&quot;, specially since nuance and details are typically lost on a thirty
        &gt; minute or one hour presentation.   If you get an audience to get one or two
        &gt; messages out of a presentation you would be lucky, a session packed with
        &gt; information would likely have the nuance lost in the noise.
        &gt;
        
        With the above being said, if you think that you can do a presentation that
        would not kill us prematurely and you inject &quot;this is a very early closed
        preview&quot; every sentence, I do not think anyone would object.
        
        So use your judgement, it is not like we are going to sue anyone.   You
        would merely crush our hearts.
        
 - Jon
