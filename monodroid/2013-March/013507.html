<PRE>Hi,

I'm writing an app for a friend and he wants the UI to look more or less 
the same as the Win mobile version he has. One of the views has 4 
listviews on which are bound to the SQLlite database.

I've constructed the layout to look the same, but the implementation has 
me stumped.

Reading the tutorial docs, it seems to propogate the lists, I use 
something like

ListAdapter = new ArrayAdapter&lt;string&gt;(this, Resource.Layout.list_item, 
money);

This is fine, but obviously the app doesn't know which listview to put 
this into.

By the looks of it, I should be able to use lstMyListView.SetAdapter() 
to set the adapter to use, but from what I can see, this is pretty much 
the same as a custom view (but doesn't look like it should!)

Does anyone have some code I could look at for how to do what I need my 
app to do or any pointers on implementation, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks

Paul
