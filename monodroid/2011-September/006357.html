<PRE>I copied .cs files from compact framework 2.0 (Windows Mobile 6.x) to iOS
and then to Android and all was ok. Of course there is some issues like on
Windows Mobile I had SQL Mobile 2005 native and RDA (Remote Data Access) and
on iOS and Android is Sqlite.. S&#243;, with some extensions, inheritance and
also #ifs I get all code running and differences between SQL Mobile and
Sqlite on query syntax managed with just one query to all:

- Download/subscribe to tables on a Distributor database
- Sync data on tables that can com from devices and database
- Threads and ui threads
- Business rules
- All bugs discovered on one device, related to code and not UI when is
corrected it can be copied to all environments to correct the bug
- All new functionalities and &quot;screens&quot; can be done in all devices, just
adapting each particular objects of each OS.
- For sure it can be reprouced on Windows Phone 7.x if I use some Sqlite
there and learn it's UI.

And also it can go to Windows Desktop application, web application (with
some adaptations if you want an improved UI and shared code), Mac, Linux and
Sony &quot;future&quot; things.

So the software on windows mobile, android and iOS can connect to the same
webservices and infraestructure on server with same funcionalities, data and
client needs.

This is exactly where we are looking at Monodroid/touch and as far as I see
that is exactly the solution provided by xamarin.

Subject: [mono-android] Shared code, not UI

The bulk of our business these days is Android ports of iOS apps.
There are many &quot;cross platform&quot; solutions, but they all tend to be a pain
and don't really work as well as one would hope.  What I've been trying to
do is find a cross platform solution that would simply be a shared code
block.  Like a black box logic processor that you could deploy on either
platform, and call into it to do calculations and business logic.  The UI,
and simpler code would be handled in whatever the native platform preferred.

The obvious choice here was Javascript, but it wouldn't be my ideal choice.
Something like C# is more appealing to me.  Although not ideal itself (I'm
not sure what would be ideal yet), it seems like a promising option.

Questions:

1) Is this possible?  Specifically, starting up and calling into a mono
runtime on Android or iOS (and possibly windows phone in the future,
although you might simply able to use a library there)
2) What kind of overhead does the mono runtime have?  How much memory?
 Probably a stupid question, as the project would be dead in the water if it
didn't run well.

Any thoughts on this approach?

Thanks in advance,
-Kevin
