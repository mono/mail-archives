Jonas Folles&#248; has done a sample app with shared code between iPhone, Android and WP7 incl. a 50+ page step-by-step tutorial on how to build cross-platform mobile apps
<A HREF="https://github.com/follesoe/FlightsNorway/tree/workshop">https://github.com/follesoe/FlightsNorway/tree/workshop</A>

He did also a talk about &quot;Cross platform .NET mobile apps talk at NDC 2011&quot;
<A HREF="http://jonas.follesoe.no/2011/07/22/cross-platform-mobile-ndc-2011/">http://jonas.follesoe.no/2011/07/22/cross-platform-mobile-ndc-2011/</A>

The presentation covers 8 concrete strategies for designing applications for maximum code re-use across all three platforms, as well as techniques to make development more productive and hassle-free. The strategies/techniques covered in the presentation are:
1.Portable Class Libraries
2.Linked Files
3.The &quot;Project Linker&quot; tool
4.VSMonoTouch to open MonoTouch projects in Visual Studio
5.Pre-processor directives
6.Abstract common functionality
7.Leverage MVVM on all platforms
8.Use pre-built abstractions such as MonoMobile.Extensions

Hope this helps,
S&#248;lve

Subject: [mono-android] Shared code, not UI

The bulk of our business these days is Android ports of iOS apps.
There are many &quot;cross platform&quot; solutions, but they all tend to be a pain and don't really work as well as one would hope.  What I've been trying to do is find a cross platform solution that would simply be a shared code block.  Like a black box logic processor that you could deploy on either platform, and call into it to do calculations and business logic.  The UI, and simpler code would be handled in whatever the native platform preferred.

The obvious choice here was Javascript, but it wouldn't be my ideal choice.  Something like C# is more appealing to me.  Although not ideal itself (I'm not sure what would be ideal yet), it seems like a promising option.

Questions:

1) Is this possible?  Specifically, starting up and calling into a mono runtime on Android or iOS (and possibly windows phone in the future, although you might simply able to use a library there)
2) What kind of overhead does the mono runtime have?  How much memory?
 Probably a stupid question, as the project would be dead in the water if it didn't run well.

Any thoughts on this approach?

Thanks in advance,
-Kevin
