<PRE>
Tony,
We're like you, we're currently working on what to do regarding changes and items that are still incomplete.  I'm currently working with Wrox and Xamarin to understand what will change and how that effects us.  Specifically, we want to include mapping and tablet/honeycomb support in our book.  We (our editor at Wrox and I) believe that these are features that our readers want to know about and will give the readers the most value for their money, thus, we have decided to wait before publishing the book.  Hopefully, you will agree with this.  
Regarding the November conference, it will include:Content from March.  Many of the things that you do now, you will need in future versions of m4a.Some content that I have fixed/changed since March.  There were some things that I just flat out did wrong in March.  This content has been updated to reflect a better way of doing things.Hopefully Xamarin will have some new APIs that will be covered in November (cough......mapping......cough). 
Hopefully, you can come to conference in November and sit in.
Wally
PS.  We don't know anything more than you.  Jon has been really communicative regarding what is going to ship along with relative timeframes.

</I>&gt;<i> Having seen the March presentation, I can assure you that most of the content will align. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Much of the March presentation had to do with Android itself, e.g. what an Activity is, what a Service is, etc. As long as we're following the current &quot;expose the underlying platform&quot; approach, these concepts will remain. (We don't plan on changing our &quot;expose the underlying platform approach,&quot; ever; it's our selling point. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, it makes me wonder, are the libraries and code base for Mono for Android going through some major churn right now? Should I anticipate major changes in the forthcoming realeases?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> That depends upon how we define &quot;major changes.&quot; :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What's important? The exposed class library is important, and it's fairly stable. The only changes we plan on are additional int-&gt;enum conversions, and API additions (Honeycomb support, etc.). Consequently, code written today should continue to work as-is, and the semantics should not change. I consider this stable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The toolchain is important, e.g. how we use Visual Studio/MonoDevelop. Some of these semantics have already changed, though not necessarily in user-visible ways (e.g. per-app debug keystore to a per-user debug keystore, done in 1.0.3). The basic workflow of package creation, installation, debugging, etc. shouldn't change much.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, the question is this: what do you consider as a &quot;major change&quot;?
