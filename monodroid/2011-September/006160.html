</I>Having seen the March presentation, I can assure you that most of the content will align. :-)

Much of the March presentation had to do with Android itself, e.g. what an Activity is, what a Service is, etc. As long as we're following the current &quot;expose the underlying platform&quot; approach, these concepts will remain. (We don't plan on changing our &quot;expose the underlying platform approach,&quot; ever; it's our selling point. :-)
&gt;<i> So, it makes me wonder, are the libraries and code base for Mono for Android going through some major churn right now? Should I anticipate major changes in the forthcoming realeases?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>That depends upon how we define &quot;major changes.&quot; :-)

What's important? The exposed class library is important, and it's fairly stable. The only changes we plan on are additional int-&gt;enum conversions, and API additions (Honeycomb support, etc.). Consequently, code written today should continue to work as-is, and the semantics should not change. I consider this stable.

The toolchain is important, e.g. how we use Visual Studio/MonoDevelop. Some of these semantics have already changed, though not necessarily in user-visible ways (e.g. per-app debug keystore to a per-user debug keystore, done in 1.0.3). The basic workflow of package creation, installation, debugging, etc. shouldn't change much.

Thus, the question is this: what do you consider as a &quot;major change&quot;?
