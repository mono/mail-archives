Mono won't run on WP7 (nor native code of any kind), but Mono is on iOS via MonoTouch, and on Android via Mono for Android.

Yes, you can embed the Mono runtime in your app, and either call into it from native code (e.g. Objective-C invoking a selector on a C# type, or Java invoking a C# method), or have C# invoke native code (allowing native UI in C# on both platforms), There are some limitations and restrictions here (particularly on Android), but cross-language interop is supported on both platforms.

&gt;<i> 2) What kind of overhead does the mono runtime have?  How much memory? Probably a stupid question, as the project would be dead in the water

</I>
There are various forms of overhead, not all of which have been quantified.

In terms of distribution, Mono adds a minimum of ~4MB to the package size on both MonoTouch and Mono for Android, t hough this is highly variable and depends upon what Base Class Library types and members you use.

For execution overhead, it's context dependent: managed-&gt;managed calls will be fastest (with potential JIT inlining), while managed-&gt;native and native-&gt;managed will be slower. How important the slowdown is depends upon your app, and we haven't done any specific timing, so we can't provide any figures to help here.

For memory overhead, we JIT everything (which adds some memory pressure), but historically it hasn't been problematic.
