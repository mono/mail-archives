<PRE>The bulk of our business these days is Android ports of iOS apps.
There are many &quot;cross platform&quot; solutions, but they all tend to be a
pain and don't really work as well as one would hope.  What I've been
trying to do is find a cross platform solution that would simply be a
shared code block.  Like a black box logic processor that you could
deploy on either platform, and call into it to do calculations and
business logic.  The UI, and simpler code would be handled in whatever
the native platform preferred.

The obvious choice here was Javascript, but it wouldn't be my ideal
choice.  Something like C# is more appealing to me.  Although not
ideal itself (I'm not sure what would be ideal yet), it seems like a
promising option.

Questions:

1) Is this possible?  Specifically, starting up and calling into a
mono runtime on Android or iOS (and possibly windows phone in the
future, although you might simply able to use a library there)
2) What kind of overhead does the mono runtime have?  How much memory?
 Probably a stupid question, as the project would be dead in the water
if it didn't run well.

Any thoughts on this approach?

Thanks in advance,
-Kevin
