<PRE>Hi

Craig Dunn
<A HREF="http://conceptdev.blogspot.com/">http://conceptdev.blogspot.com/</A>
has several samples (look for Restauran Guide)

My thoughts about are inline...

&gt;<i> The bulk of our business these days is Android ports of iOS apps.

</I>&gt;<i> deploy on either platform, and call into it to do calculations and
</I>&gt;<i> business logic.  The UI, and simpler code would be handled in whatever
</I>&gt;<i> the native platform preferred.
</I>     There would be 2 concepts:

 1. sharing on binary level (PInvoke, callable wrappers (COM, .net,
    android, ...)
 2. sharing on source level with MonoTouch/MonoForAndroid/Mono*

Cons for 1.

  * You still need experts in underlying tech that would maintain that
    code if  problems
    arise in that part.


Pros for 1.

  * Less to do. Just wrap and go...


Pros for 2.

  * For BusinessLayer only .net programmers are needed...
  * Core can be shared accross projects
    In our case 3 apps currently wp7, monodroid, starting monotouch
    (iOS), silverlight,
    desktop (WF and WPF), asp.net.
  * sharing not only cs code
    just writing small writeup how to share XAML code accros WP7,
    Silverlight and WPF
  * unit testing
      o take desktop version in solution add unit tests and You can
        cover a lot, really a lot

Cons for 2.

  * need to get used with new tools Project Linker/Productivity Tools etc...
    Microsoft came out few years ago with excellent tool Project Linker
    for sharing
    SL and WPF code.
    Today thanks to Mono* you can use it for far more!
    I can rember sharing SL code with desktop by tweaking assemblies!
    (let's say binary level, no thanks)
  * need to find smallest common denominator for tools/features
    for us WP7 (WP7 project is source for linked cs files all other
    projects)
      o going from superset app (desktop) to subset (mobile,
        silverlight) rewrite all
        code to async, sync versions are kept only in desktop and
        asp.net versions.
        I know that was mistake at the beginning, but at that point that
        was the fastest
        solution, never thought I will program mobile apps.
  * faster growing number of projects in solution
    #platforms_targeted * #architectural_layers
    Most superset projects (desktop, asp.net) are almost empty
  * quite a bit knowledge about diffs between .net and mono...
    remember when we hit the wall by using Observable collection for
    WP7, SL,
    Then MonoDroid came in.
    Cannot rember which mono base was then, but Observable Collection
    was not there)
    But everything can be done:
    pulled source fore several classes to shtuup the compiler from
    <A HREF="http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/CSharp/2.6.4-mono-.net-core/System.Collections/System/Collections/ObjectModel/ObservableCollection.cs.htm">http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/CSharp/2.6.4-mono-.net-core/System.Collections/System/Collections/ObjectModel/ObservableCollection.cs.htm</A>
    Voila...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The obvious choice here was Javascript, but it wouldn't be my ideal
</I>&gt;<i> choice.  Something like C# is more appealing to me.  Although not
</I>&gt;<i> ideal itself (I'm not sure what would be ideal yet), it seems like a
</I>&gt;<i> promising option.
</I>     I'm ready to bet on Mono*

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is this possible?  Specifically, starting up and calling into a
</I>&gt;<i> mono runtime on Android or iOS (and possibly windows phone in the
</I>&gt;<i> future, although you might simply able to use a library there)
</I>If You go for 2nd solution

  * cons:
      o you'll have to rewrite iOS app in C#
          + should not be a big problem (mobile apps are small)
          + have common base for oter projects/platforms
  * pros:
      o common BL
      o iOS xib can be reused...
      o open doors for implementation on other platforms


&gt;<i> 2) What kind of overhead does the mono runtime have?  How much memory?
</I>&gt;<i>   Probably a stupid question, as the project would be dead in the water
</I>&gt;<i> if it didn't run well.
</I>Hard to tell depends on use... remember few reports where MonoDroid 
tests where
faster than java equivalents.
Test can be always tweaked to show what I want to see...
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts on this approach?
</I>     A lot...
