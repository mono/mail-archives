<PRE>This is exactly where we are looking at Monodroid/touch and as far as I see
that is exactly the solution provided by xamarin.

Subject: [mono-android] Shared code, not UI

The bulk of our business these days is Android ports of iOS apps.
There are many &quot;cross platform&quot; solutions, but they all tend to be a pain
and don't really work as well as one would hope.  What I've been trying to
do is find a cross platform solution that would simply be a shared code
block.  Like a black box logic processor that you could deploy on either
platform, and call into it to do calculations and business logic.  The UI,
and simpler code would be handled in whatever the native platform preferred.

The obvious choice here was Javascript, but it wouldn't be my ideal choice.
Something like C# is more appealing to me.  Although not ideal itself (I'm
not sure what would be ideal yet), it seems like a promising option.

Questions:

1) Is this possible?  Specifically, starting up and calling into a mono
runtime on Android or iOS (and possibly windows phone in the future,
although you might simply able to use a library there)
2) What kind of overhead does the mono runtime have?  How much memory?
 Probably a stupid question, as the project would be dead in the water if it
didn't run well.

Any thoughts on this approach?

Thanks in advance,
-Kevin
