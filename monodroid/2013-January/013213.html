<PRE>I'm looking for something similar to this as well. I have a 12 year old that
I bought a tablet for for Christmas and all of the Parental Control apps out
there just aren't doing what I want. Basically all they do is either monitor
positioning and web browsing, give you the ability to block apps or web
content, or turn the device into a total toddler device consisting of a
hideous looking app drawer and completely doing away with the Android
experience.

I don't have a problem so much with my son sneaking around behind my back
and doing things he's not supposed to, nor do I really have any issues with
trusting him as of yet. My problems are with the content he sometimes views
on youtube and his non-stop gaming. I don't want to completely block youtube
or the games, I just want to limit them while still affording him the use of
the tablet and it's unique functions.

Basically what I have in mind is to merge a custom launcher like GO Launcher
or whatever, but include the parental controls focusing on content blocking
and specific app time limiting. Maybe having the ability to automatically
detect and categorize existing and newly downloaded apps into separate
folders that render like individual app drawers. Then I would like to have
the ability to set time limits/curfews as to how long certain types of apps
can be used, such as &quot;no more than two hours of game play a day between the
hours of 3pm and 8pm&quot;. This might be possible by having some kind of app
clocker which clocks the usage of any apps accessed within specific
categories. That way you don't have an app that's constantly running all the
time, it only activates when a specific folder such as &quot;games&quot; is accessed.

The reason I want something like this is because I still want my son to have
the ability to access his settings and have control over his device such as
the ability to install and uninstall apps and move apps to his SD card and
even connect to other WiFi networks. I mean, I want him to have the ability
to manage his device based on his surroundings and such. And I also don't
want to prevent him from having the ability to use his device for other
things such as organization. The other thing that I really don't want to do
is limit this device to the point that he can't learn from it such as how it
works and how technology can be used and improved. I just don't want him
simply using it just to play games and further isolate himself from the
world.

Let me know if you come up with an idea of how to make this work.
