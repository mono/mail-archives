<PRE>Hi Folks,

I recently purchased Mono for Android Professional (I am using MonoDevelop
on Windows XP SP3), and after installation I created an empty project and
chose &quot;Run | Start Without Debugging...&quot;.

On the &quot;Select Device&quot; window, I saw the text &quot;Trial version only supports
the emulator.&quot;, and saw the &quot;Activate&quot; button.

After entering all of my information, I clicked on the Activate button and
received the following red error message:

&quot;Activation failed: Please check your activation code&quot;

I checked my activation code and it was correct. I also checked my &quot;Full
Name&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;, &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Phone Number&quot;, and all were spot-on matches to
exactly the same information I purchased the product with.

I clicked on the Activate button again.

The same message was issued: &quot;Activation failed: Please check your
activation code&quot;.

I closed MonoDevelop, re-booted my machine, came back into MonoDevelop, ran
my project, again entered my registration info, clicked on the Activate
button again, and the same message was issued: &quot;Activation failed: Please
check your activation code&quot;.

I sent an E-MAIL to Xamarin, waited 4 days, and did not receive a response.

I then concluded that they would likely not respond to me. Don't know why,
but after 4 days you kind of &quot;get the message&quot;, which appeared to me: &quot;you
are on your own to solve this&quot;.

I then went to Xamarin's site to search for info on registration
troubleshooting, and came across this notion of &quot;Offline Activation&quot;. Seemed
like a good fit for me.

The docs for offline activation recommended I create this folder (which I
did)...

C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Mono for
Android\License

...and put a file in it, i.e., a file created by the offline activation
procedure. Off I was to the offline activation procedure...

Using IE, I went to this page to check my license and view/perform the
offline activation procedure:

<A HREF="https://store.xamarin.com/Account/Products">https://store.xamarin.com/Account/Products</A>

I clicked on the &quot;Problem Activating?&quot; link and a white window appeared. I
quickly deduced that this was some sort of browser/CSS issue and switched
browsers to FireFox, went back to the same site, and a black offline
activation procedure window (a black CSS layer of some sort) was displayed.

The instructions on the black offline activation procedure window displayed
tips for Windows and Mac OS/X, and since I am using Windows (Windows XP SP3)
I read the Windows section, which read:

&quot;In Mono for Android 1.0.21316 and later, if activation within Visual Studio
fails then a MfaActivation.dat file will be created within the Documents
folder. Select this file below.&quot;

This does not apply to me because I am using MonoDevelop (don't have Visual
Studio) and thus there is no MfaActivation.dat file to select.


The fields &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;, &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Phone&quot;, and &quot;Activation Code&quot; were
all pre-populated with my correct information, and Activation File and
Upgrade Code were both blank.

Since this option appears to depend upon the file uploaded in the field
&quot;Activation File&quot;, and since I am running under Windows without Visual
Studio and did not have that file (MfaActivation.dat) I could not, it
appears, use the Offline activation procedure.

Because I was stuck, I decided to check every web posting I could find
(stackoverflow, this forum, the Xamarin support site, general Google
searches) and I was able to find 2 general groups of information:

1. Activation is a problem for a number of folks due to &quot;authenticating
proxy&quot; issues.
2. Use mandroid.exe command line tricks to get registered.


I checked my IE proxy settings on my machine (I don't use an authenticating
proxy) and there were none.

I use a Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Router (model WNDR3400) router, and
as far as I can tell, I am like any other schmo with an internet connection.

That left me with only the command line mandroid.exe activation trickery,
which I did as (using all my valid purchase information):

*c:
cd &quot;C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Novell&quot;
mandroid.exe --activate --name &quot;MyName&quot; --company &quot;MyCompany&quot; --email
&quot;MyEmail&quot; --phone &quot;MyCode&quot; --code &quot;99999-99999-99999-99999-99999&quot;

*This command completed immediately with no response.

I then ran this command, as I had seen a post which indicated that the error
level returned by mandroid.exe would reveal if the product was activated or
not:

*c:
cd &quot;C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Novell&quot;
mandroid.exe --activated &amp;&amp; echo &quot;activated&quot;
*
The value returned was:

*&quot;activated&quot;
*
I then came back into MonoDevelop, ran my project, and the message &quot;Trial
version only supports the emulator.&quot; appeared again.

I then ran my final command before realizing this had all been for naught:

*c:
cd &quot;C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Novell&quot;
mandroid.exe --activated &gt; %TEMP%\o.txt 2&gt;%TEMP%\e.txt &amp; echo %errorlevel%
*
The value returned was:

*&quot;License file is missing.  Please activate Mono for Android.&quot;
*

I lastly added C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Novell;C:\Program
Files\MonoDevelop\bin to my Windows path, thinking that somehow there were
Xamarin assemblies that were not being found by either MonoDevelop and/or
Mono for Android and that this causing the activation procedure to fail.
This did not solve the problem.

A reasonable person might conclude from this experience that I just
purchased a trial for $400.

What am I missing here?

Any help would be appreciated.

Regards,
Tony.
