<PRE>Thanks for the suggestions  much much appreciated 

However ... as you said, I&#146;ve deinstalled everything from the mobile I&#146;m
testing on (two actually a Samsung Galaxy tablet running Honeycomb and a
sony xperia running ICS) 

It also doesn&#146;t work on the emulator (I&#146;ve had situations before where i
couldn&#146;t debug on the emulator so thats no big deal) 

 

Will try a restart 

 

Thanks again   -keep the suggestions coming 

John Murray

John,

 

You probably did this step already, but just in case. I also had the same
problem when installing the new version. The only way I got it to work again
was to clean the whole solution, uninstall shared runtime, mono framework
and my application from the device and then running it again. Someone also
reported that a debug restart fixed it, though it didn't for me.

Further to my last post
I've now tried 4 old back up projects and none can be made to debug properly
Sorry to be a complete plank but can anyone tell me the steps I need to take
to de install 4.4.41 and go back to whatever was current last August?
I'm getting desperate for a debuggable solution so that some work can be
done over the holiday (sad I know :-(   )

I've posted a bug

For gen information
 A newly created project stops at breakpoints as it should I recalled that
two other 'tricks' were to delete the obj and bin folders or to delete mdb
and pdb files Neither of these work Obviously after each step obe cleans and
builds

I've imported a back up copy of the project  - no luck - it took out
MonoDevelop (could not see  cause of crash but a message said the details
had been sent to developer) After that Monodevelop is back to being an
evaluation versio (see other thread on activation) so I'll have to do an
offline activation again

As it is something to dowith my project and its interaction with the new
version any other suggestions would be welcome.  Such a time waster

Could you please file a bug so that we can track this?

Apparently a .suo file contains user options; I have no idea why this would
break debugging. :-(

Without knowing why things are breaking, I can't say one way or the other.
It doesn't make sense to me why an uninstall+reinstall would change
anything...
