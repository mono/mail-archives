<PRE>I've posted a bug

For gen information  
 A newly created project stops at breakpoints as it should
I recalled that two other 'tricks' were to delete the obj and bin folders
or to delete mdb and pdb files
Neither of these work 
Obviously after each step obe cleans and builds

I've imported a back up copy of the project  - no luck - it took out
MonoDevelop (could not see  cause of crash but a message said the details
had been sent to developer) After that Monodevelop is back to being an
evaluation versio (see other thread on activation) so I'll have to do an
offline activation again

As it is something to dowith my project and its interaction with the new
version any other suggestions would be welcome.  Such a time waster

Could you please file a bug so that we can track this?

Apparently a .suo file contains user options; I have no idea why this would
break debugging. :-(

&gt;<i> 3)      Is there something else I should be deinstalling?
</I>&gt;<i> 4)      Does VS2010 or Monodevelop have to be deinstalled
</I>
Without knowing why things are breaking, I can't say one way or the other.
It doesn't make sense to me why an uninstall+reinstall would change
anything...
