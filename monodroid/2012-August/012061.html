<PRE>Damn, I was hoping you would get further :-)

It surprises me that so little is talked about in-app billing. I remember
reading that out of the top 20 Android apps, 18 of them use in-app billing
to generate their sales. Now with subscriptions it would indicate that this
is a vital revenue stream for developers. I could be wrong, but after all my
internet research and scouring this forum it's just getting overlooked by
everyone with Monodroid.

Personally I would prefer not to use a JAR file. Only because Google
emphasises heavily on obfuscating code. Even the public key should be built,
not just a simple copy+paste.

The Licensing LVL code uses the stub approach and works fine, however they
don't use bundles. Also they don't have return values, just void. I examined
their code in GitHub here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/mattleibow/Android.Play.ExpansionLibrary">https://github.com/mattleibow/Android.Play.ExpansionLibrary</A>

I wondering if there could be a bug with Xamarin's code?? 

Unfortunately I don't know enough yet to say one way or another.

What research I have done says that the &quot;bad magic number&quot; is more a case of
not using an Android Market app that is up-to-date. However I know mine is
plus I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S2 with ICS.

I don't know if it helps (I'm currently on my break at my fulltime job,
Android programming is partime) but I found this link that has the
Android.OS.Parcelable code. This shows how a &quot;bad magic number&quot; can happen.

Thanks for trying, I haven't given up yet. Just hit a roadblock with this
error :-(
