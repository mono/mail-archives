<PRE>Hi,

I'm using some similar approach too but the problem is that you are losing
some part of the your toolchain namely the ability to refactor code is
reduced. The different files (linked or not) are usually not seen as real
dependency so rename or so fails (correct me when I'm wrong but this happend
to me alot). There are some issues with multiple opened files and debugger
weirdness too.

This drawback brings me to another solution that can be a partial solution.
Since some time Microsoft supports Portable Library Tools which include
subsets of some frameworks (Windows Phone, Silverlight, Metro, .NET). There
are some tweaks around to make it work with MonoForAndroid or even with
MonoTouch. The problem is that the library is build against this special
subset framework and lots of features are still missing. It's not compiled
against the mono libs, so there is no compile check but as long as you are
using base library functions and WP/Silverlight as target mono should have
it.

The real advantage is that you have ONE library as real dependency for your
projects and this allows you to use the regular toolchain.  For example you
can rename a method of your shared lib in an android project and the same
change is seen in WP project with same shared lib.

The downside is the wrong compilation target. So far I never had problems
with it but maybe someone from Xamarin could give a statement about the
general compatibility  between a PLT output and M4A.
