<PRE>Mark, thanks for posting that stub code. I just got it in my sample
application, and am now seeing exactly what you are seeing. I'll reply if I
find out anything new.

Before I had tried your code, I tried to message Google Play via the
Messenger/Handler mechanism. This was basically how the
MessengerServiceActivities.java sample is set up in the Android SDK samples.
I was able to bind, however no messages were coming in to my incoming
handler after being sent by my outgoing messenger (when attaching the
incoming messenger to a message). I don't know why this would not work,
though I see that in the in-app billing guide for Google Play, that Google
Play responds with broadcast intents
(<A HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/google/play/billing/billing_integrate.html">http://developer.android.com/guide/google/play/billing/billing_integrate.html</A>).
/*Can anyone confirm that Google Play would not work with the
Messenger/Handler mechanism?*/

I then tried to use a BroadcastReceiver to receive any possible broadcast
from Google Play after sending a message through a Messenger (after the
service is connected), but that didn't work as well.

If we're unable to get your stub/proxy to work, would another alternative be
to consider using google's in-app billing sample in a &quot;Java Bindings
Library&quot; project? Would that work?
