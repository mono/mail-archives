<PRE>Don't get me wrong, I love MonoDroid. Linking JAR files is now so easy. I was
able to add Google Analytics to my apps with virtually no issues.

But what surprises me is the lack of support for licensing and in-app
billing (and now subscriptions). As we are talking $$$$ here surely
developers would see this more as a need over a want?

Back in January this year, after scouring the web and emailing a developer
who had started on licensing, I was finally able to get this to work. He did
all the hard work mind you of converting Java LVL files to C#. It works
brilliantly. I certainly can't take any credit for it.

I work on MonoDroid in my own hours outside of my regular fulltime job so
R&amp;D into such areas is really slow going.

If people like it I can upload his C# licensing code here.

An example that uses it is a retro text adventure game I did. The demo is a
free cut down version but the full licensed version is here:
<A HREF="https://market.android.com/details?id=Mystery.Complete">https://market.android.com/details?id=Mystery.Complete</A>

Again, however, there is very little information for MonoDroid for in-app
billing. I found someone started converting Java files to C# here:
<A HREF="https://github.com/jmawebtech/MonoGame-StarterKits/tree/master/Android/InAppBilling">https://github.com/jmawebtech/MonoGame-StarterKits/tree/master/Android/InAppBilling</A>

And that's about it. I noticed a couple of posts here by people asking about
in-app billing but they haven't got replies. The latest I found was by Nino
here:
<A HREF="http://mono-for-android.1047100.n5.nabble.com/InApp-Billing-on-Mono-for-Android-tt5711040.html">http://mono-for-android.1047100.n5.nabble.com/InApp-Billing-on-Mono-for-Android-tt5711040.html</A>

There is also a post here back in December 2011 talking about using JNI
files:
<A HREF="http://mono-for-android.1047100.n5.nabble.com/using-Android-market-licensing-LVL-with-mono-td5041422.html">http://mono-for-android.1047100.n5.nabble.com/using-Android-market-licensing-LVL-with-mono-td5041422.html</A>

I remember initially trying this for licensing. It was extremely slow going
and difficult. That's why I was so happy to find a C# conversion.

Can't Xamarin convert the files from Java to C#? Then let us, the
developers, obfuscate the code to frustrate the hackers.

Xamrin are experts at converting Java to C#. Just read this:
<A HREF="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/05/xamarin-releases-xobotos-the-net-powered-version-of-android/">http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/05/xamarin-releases-xobotos-the-net-powered-version-of-android/</A>

Sure this would be a simple and easy exercise for Xamarin?  (or am I over
simplifying this?)


Kind regards

Mark Eaton
