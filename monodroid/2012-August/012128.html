<PRE>yeah I have to say the majority of questions I see come across this list as
&quot;problems&quot; are more related to the android os, not the the m4a. One of the
most common one's I've seen is in regards to listview and getting an item
at a certain position. The docs are obfuscated in a way and that's when you
can actually find them through a slew of as*hats trying to out seo them so
you get to their crappy blog with their crappy example that is really
flawed so you end up messaging them and paying them for work.


Here is the path to figuring out m4a.

1, search for -stackoverflow -bigresource monodroid *classorissuehere*

for example:

-stackoverflow -bigresource monodroid listview


Sometimes it's android it self that is confusing. For example, in adapter
view there is a property on the returned view that is .position, but it has
nothing to do with the items position in a list. You have to know that
you need to call getPositionForView with the view.

<A HREF="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterView.html#getPositionForView%28android.view.View%29">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterView.html#getPositionForView%28android.view.View%29</A>



It's stupid. I mean, the whole idea behind java was to be a language to
ease people into c++. A learning tool for universities. It was for people
who couldn't understand pointers but would eventually.

So a learning tool as a foundation for a language. PLEASE! Any code written
in c++ vs java I would say is always 10x faster and 10x as small. I
recently wrote a page in c++ using lighttpd and compared it to my friend's
ruby install.
His server crapped out after about 2k simultaneous connections. WE couldn't
make my server crap out with all out machines (about 10, blasting it)
together.

Point is, getting hired at google doesn't mean you are good. It means you
had good recommendations. So whomever was in charge of the mobile phone
design was obviously someone who learned java in college but never realized
they were scootin long with training wheels still on. Makes me sad.
