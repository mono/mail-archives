<PRE>Hi mel

I think it's the language barrier - I felt you were hinting at &quot;it's not
appropriate to complain&quot; - and I think it's appropriate if you have just
cause.

We have the situation where you can call some code and don't really know
whether it will work until you've tried (e.g. getting the network
information, or wcf). There's also inexplicable strange behavior (see my
posts with regards to instantiating my singleton object from a background
thread), or Data Contract Serializers being able to deserialize a json
string on PC, but failing on the same json string on MonoDroid (will file a
bug on that and post here - I've had to manually rewrite json data I get
from GCM because somewhere along the way it inverts my keys and values in a
dictionary object).

If I just begrudgingly develop workarounds and never tell Xamarin about
issues I'm facing, the product cannot get better.

I realize I'm a n00b and have to go through the learning curve - but I've
gone PC to mobile client before many eons ago, and the process from PC to
PocketPC was in a lot of ways a much better experience. You have a list of
APis that are supported so you can pick and chose what to use for the PC
client (lowest common denominator), and whatever API you use that has been
marked as working on the mobile platform will work. There was some
funkyness, but the process was essentially smooth. I erroneously assumed it
would be similar with M4A.

I'm hoping that M4A will continue to improve so that our experience will get
smoother over time. The premise of the product is amazing, the execution,
imho, doesn't fully live up to it, yet. Not to say that Android in itself
does, either (my list of things that absolutely should change is as long in
Android 4.1 as it was when I got my first iPhone) - but there's nothing that
Xamarin can do about limitations of the underlying OS.

Now to file that bug...

Cheers
Stephan



What I did not understand is &quot;sitting on my mouth&quot;... It felt like I'm 
hiding some info...
And who_the_fake am i??

cheers
