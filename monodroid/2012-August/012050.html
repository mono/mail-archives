<PRE>Cheers for the replies guys...

My app is a drill-down app with a lot of data and a lot of nested ListViews,
so it's crucial that the navigation is good so people can get to info
quickly and logically.

I've been working with ActivityGroup, although I know that it is deprecated.
I have it working but it's still a little buggy when navigating back, but
I'm sure I can fix that.

I thought of using fragments but my target Android version is 2.2 (Froyo)
and above and I read that Mono for Android doesn't support fragments in
anything under 3.0 (yet).

I would have thought it was simpler to implement having a set of tabs
positioned either top or bottom, which would act as global navigation and be
available on each Activity.

Consider the following:

- Main Activity shows an ImageView and a ListView with 4 tabs at the bottom
- User taps on ListView item, which shows another ListView, when tapped,
shows another (tabs are no longer visible after the main screen)

Unless the user hits back a few times to get back to the Main Activity, they
can't get to the other screens which are reached from the other 3 tabs.

I could easily add buttons to go directly to the Main Activity but I don't
want to do that. The global navigation should be available on all screens as
I've implemented in iOS.
