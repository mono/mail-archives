</I>&gt;<i> But i can't figure out why it cannot load libQCAR.so, as that is definately in the apk, in the same place as libQCARWrapper.so. So I would assume if it can find one, it can find the other.

You would think so, and you would be wrong.

Here's the problem: Android doesn't set LD_LIBRARY_PATH after the process is forked, and thus ld.so doesn't know to check the /data/data/your.package.name/lib directory; everything passed to dlopen() is fully qualified.

Result: you have libQCARWrapper.so which has a link-time dependency on libQCAR.so, but when you load libQCARWrapper.so dlopen(3) doesn't know to check your app's lib directory to find libQCAR.so, so it fails the load.

What's the fix?

&gt;<i> Yes, and this is the documented behaviour: you must load libraries in reverse dependency order explicitely. [0]
</I>
As the note says, you need to do one of two things:

(1) Find a &quot;safe&quot; function in libQCAR.so that you can P/Invoke AND INVOKE before you call your libQCARWrapper.so function. When you invoke the libQCAR.so function, libQCAR.so will be loaded, allowing your libQCARWrapper.so function invocation to work.

(2) P/Invoke to dlopen(3) and explicitly dlopen(&quot;path/to/libQCAR.so&quot;). The downside is that you'll need to know what &quot;path/to&quot; is; given that anyone (and everyone!) can modify Android, it's safest to use the ApplicationInfo.NativeLibraryDir property [2]. The problem is that ApplicationInfo.NativeLibraryDir was added in API9, so if you want to target anything older you'll need to assume something; Mono for Android assumes that native libraries are stored in Path.Combine(ApplicationInfo.DataDir, &quot;lib&quot;) (see e.g. the generated obj\Debug\android\src\mono\MonoPackageManager.java).

Of course, both approaches require that your native libraries have no circular dependencies, as there's no way to individually load libraries if they have a circular link-time dependency...

Finally, do note the cautionary note at the end of the above android-ndk forum message:

&gt;<i> Some people have been playing with rpath to embed the full path of dependent libraries in the .so itself, but this is no[t] guaranteed to work (e.g. it will break if you move the app to the SD Card, because now the libraries are in a directory with a completely different path, most of it random iirc).

[0] Though I do wish I knew _where_ this was &quot;documented behavior&quot;, as [1] doesn't find anything meaningful...
