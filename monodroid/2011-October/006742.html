<PRE>If you mean &quot;when the app is idle and in the foreground,&quot; the way that I would probably do it is by having an &quot;idleStuff&quot; thread that you pause in all of your Activity.Pause() overrides, and that resumes at the ends of your Activity.OnResume() overrides. If you also want it to do things while your app is not actively being interacted with by the user, you might want to write a Service. In any case, your idle tasks _must_ happen on a non-UI thread, otherwise the user will be completely unable to use your app.

Of course, it also depends on what you're trying to do. I seem to remember that there was a bug at one point where objects that were unmanaged by Dalvik (such as ones used in Mono's .NET threads!) were liable to be GC'd. I'm not sure if this is still the case. For every project that I've used m4a on so far, I haven't been able to get threading to work at all, and have needed to run everything on the UI thread. However, that issue sounds like it may have been fixed with the latest releases of Mono-Android, so your mileage may vary.

Subject: [mono-android] Idle Handler?

Does anybody know how to implement an idle handler? I want to execute some stuff when the app is idle.

Thank you.
