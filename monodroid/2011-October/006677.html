There are _lots_ of potential reasons for this. :-)

1. Release builds (which are deployable to the Android Market, and which you mentioned later) bundles the runtime and links all required assemblies in order to minimize application size. Debug builds don't do that (by default):

	<A HREF="http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/linking">http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/linking</A>

This is the most plausible reason for your ClassNotFoundException -- you've performed a Release (linking) build, and the linker failed. Try rebuilding with linking disabled for whatever assembly contains the missing type, and please file a bug at bugzilla.xamarin.com (assuming that the &quot;much smarter&quot; linker in 1.9.1 doesn't fix the issue).

2. For Debug builds (by default), Installing a .apk outside of the IDE won't result installing the required shared runtime packages, which will result in numerous errors when attempting to launch the application.

3. The shared runtime is not ABI stable. If you deploy the shared runtime to your device and then later upgrade your Mono for Android install, if the shared runtime isn't upgraded on your device all sorts of bizarre things will break.

I'm probably missing other scenarios, and the differences between Release and Debug builds will only increase over time (in order to speed up developer turnaround while debugging).

As far as the TypeInitializationException from System.Net.Sockets.Socket, unfortunately we're going to need a bug filed for that one, as we don't see any way for an exception to be emitted from the System.Net.Sockets.Socket static constructor:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/mono-2-10/mcs/class/System/System.Net.Sockets/Socket_2_1.cs#L770">https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/mono-2-10/mcs/class/System/System.Net.Sockets/Socket_2_1.cs#L770</A>

If someone seeing this could file a bug with a reproducible test case, it would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
 - Jon
