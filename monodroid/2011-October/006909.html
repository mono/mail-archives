<PRE>I am exploring using Google docs from my mandroid app - I'm in the process
of reading around and experimenting 

Can anyone give me some help on these - sorry about the dumb nature of some
questions 

 

1)      I presume one can't use the Google  .net libraries in Mandroid as
they seem to be windows dll's ? or have it got that wrong?

2)      Therefore one would use a web request or webclient 

I'm happily using a webclient to post xml, get a stream back and turn it
into bitmaps using a weather service so I have some familiarity here - I
tried using the same sort of approach with Google but can't get past the
authorisation- Am I banging my head against a brick wall here? Should it be
possible to authorise and download using
webclient.UploadData(url,&quot;POST&quot;,arrayofheaders) ? or should one be using a
webrequest()  - not sure I understand the subtleties.

 

3)      I am confused by the google documentation about authorisation - it
seems to have several ways of doing it - I'm trying to keep it simple with
just a client login but even in the documentation this bangs on a about a
'captcha' response = all serving to confuse

 

4)      I can find endless examples of python and php connecting to
Googledocs and even a few iOs examples but none very helpful unless you
understand those languages and as usual most of them are buried under layers
of abstraction.  Can anyone suggest some reading which might be more
appropriate to c#  and mandroid? Or has anyone done this and has some few
lines of  code for something as simple as getting a list of available files?
I find I learn mostly by example

 

TIA 

John M
