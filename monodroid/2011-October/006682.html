<PRE>Hi Jon,

       Warning. I am writing this from Memory when I last observed
this error (few months back). This error is benign.

This error last time I debugged deep into mono and found that this was
related to IPv4 and IPv6 Address Family checking, When I was porting
System.Web to Android/IOS and for Android i was able to avoid the
error by implementing some other work arround, but I believe IOS is
still getting the error and will verify and get back to you on Monday
since I have to switch my development to Mac (currently busy with
Android Dev) and verify again and that I can do only on Monday as I am
preparing my self to for a 54hr Startup Weekend.

       When I executed the following function to get a Free Port, I
used to observe this error.

       Socket socket = null;
       bool ret =true;
       try
       {
             IPAddress ipAddress = IPAddress.Loopback;
              socket = new Socket(ipAddress.AddressFamily,
SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
              if (socket != null)
                {
                    socket.SetSocketOption(SocketOptionLevel.Socket,
SocketOptionName.ExclusiveAddressUse, true);
                    socket.Bind(new IPEndPoint(IPAddress.Any, port));
                    socket.Listen(5);
                }
                ret = true;
            }
            catch { ret = false; }
            finally { if (socket != null) socket.Close(); }

           Everything seems to work, but just that exception is
raised. I have also observed in the adb logs this error many times -
DEBUG/SntpClient(60): request time failed: java.net.SocketException:
Address family not supported by protocol

           I believe this exception is raised during socket creation
using IPv4 or IPv6 Address Family when that particular Family is not
supported in the OS? and I even tried to pass
AddressFamily.InterNetwork, AddressFamily.InterNetworkV6 with some
checking using (Socket.SupportsIPv4 == true) or (Socket.OSSupportsIPv6
== true), but still the exception gets raised. After spending too much
time on this and finally I wrote a work arround using

IPGlobalProperties ipGlobalProperties =
IPGlobalProperties.GetIPGlobalProperties();
                IPEndPoint[] endPoints =
ipGlobalProperties.GetActiveTcpListeners();

to find free port. Unfortunately this does not work in MonoTouch and
since any way this error is not creating any problems, I stopped
further work on this.

          Sorry for writing without being very sure. I just wanted to
tell what I observed so that you may make a better sense on it and not
spend too much time in your busy schedule.

Best Regards,
Sridharan Srinivasan

</I>&gt;<i> There are _lots_ of potential reasons for this. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Release builds (which are deployable to the Android Market, and which you mentioned later) bundles the runtime and links all required assemblies in order to minimize application size. Debug builds don't do that (by default):

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the most plausible reason for your ClassNotFoundException -- you've performed a Release (linking) build, and the linker failed. Try rebuilding with linking disabled for whatever assembly contains the missing type, and please file a bug at bugzilla.xamarin.com (assuming that the &quot;much smarter&quot; linker in 1.9.1 doesn't fix the issue).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. For Debug builds (by default), Installing a .apk outside of the IDE won't result installing the required shared runtime packages, which will result in numerous errors when attempting to launch the application.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The shared runtime is not ABI stable. If you deploy the shared runtime to your device and then later upgrade your Mono for Android install, if the shared runtime isn't upgraded on your device all sorts of bizarre things will break.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm probably missing other scenarios, and the differences between Release and Debug builds will only increase over time (in order to speed up developer turnaround while debugging).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as the TypeInitializationException from System.Net.Sockets.Socket, unfortunately we're going to need a bug filed for that one, as we don't see any way for an exception to be emitted from the System.Net.Sockets.Socket static constructor:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone seeing this could file a bug with a reproducible test case, it would be much appreciated.
