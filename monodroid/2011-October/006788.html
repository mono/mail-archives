<PRE>I'm experiencing the same thing. In my case I believe it is caused by
switching between vpn'ing from home on my laptop, and connecting it
directly to the work network. Often when I change between these two I
have to re-activate, taking up another of my licenses until I run out,
and have to contact support to reset the count.

I've informed them of the issue, hopefully it's on their list of things
to fix.

Subject: [mono-android] Activation Lost

Hi, 

We have 2 enterprise license, but recently our VS MonoDorid Add-in is
losing
its registration information . Today when it asked us to activate again
it
giving us a message that the product is already registered. We need help
as
soon as possible. 

Why MonoDroid keep losing the registration information? We have it
installed
since July and it was working fine until the last couple of days.

Thanks,
