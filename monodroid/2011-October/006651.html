<PRE>I have several Activities that make Web Service calls. The Web Service calls
are actually Synchronous (they will time-out); but, they are run on a
separate thread so the UI continues (per some documentation I found).

If the Activity is interrupted by the user pressing the device's &quot;Home&quot;
button, is the Activity process killed immediately, including the threads
that may be waiting for Web Service call returns? If so, is there some way
to define a &quot;critical region&quot; that can't be interrupted? I've figured out
how to block the &quot;Back Button&quot;; but I can't do much about &quot;Home&quot; or things
like incoming phone calls interrupting the current Activity.

Trying to &quot;Save State&quot; at the Activity/Application level to include
interrupted thread-waiting Activities really seems like a lot of work. I
hope I haven't created a monster by following the documentation on Web
Service calls.

Detailed testing by button-pushing (non-developer) testers is producing some
ugly errors having to do with synchronization. Any help is greatly
appreciated.
