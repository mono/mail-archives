<PRE>Just out of curiosity - as my general newbie/needy post (see below)  is not
attracting much attentionL

 

Is one supposed to be able to compile the Google.Gdata libraries into a
Mandroid app?

 

I've got what I want to do happening in a winform app

I've ported same code into an M-Android app and put in same references 

Whooopee it compiles 

Even runs fine but whilst I can step through the preliminary process (giving
it credentials etc)  everything seems fine until I fire the key line....

Feed&lt;Document&gt; feed = this.request.GetEverything();

 

I  cant see whats returned - i've tried testing for null, try/catch  etc but
whilst it seems to perform and move to next piece of code, as soon as you
try to look at 'feed' even in a watch then mono falls over with code 255. 

This is in vs2010   - 

currently I've had  MD 2.8.1 falling over every five seconds with unhandleds
- 

System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an
object.

   at
MonoDevelop.Ide.Gui.BackgroundProgressMonitor.&lt;&gt;c__DisplayClass5.&lt;OnProgress
Changed&gt;b__4(Object , EventArgs )

   at Gtk.Application.InvokeCB.Invoke()

   at GLib.Timeout.TimeoutProxy.Handler() 

hangs the whole show and you have to reboot to get rid of the monodevelop
splash screen 

I've reinstalled and it seems OK on my normal apps but it wont go near this
one - falls over as soon as I try to run it. 

 

So once again - am I wasting my time on this - are the gdata dll's not
supposed to work with mono ? 

Is that the cause of the grief?

and do I have to go back to using a webrequest or something like that 

 

TIA for any pointer whatsoever

Subject: [mono-android] using Google docs from mandroid

 

I am exploring using Google docs from my mandroid app - I'm in the process
of reading around and experimenting 

Can anyone give me some help on these - sorry about the dumb nature of some
questions 

 

1)      I presume one can't use the Google  .net libraries in Mandroid as
they seem to be windows dll's ? or have it got that wrong?

2)      Therefore one would use a web request or webclient 

I'm happily using a webclient to post xml, get a stream back and turn it
into bitmaps using a weather service so I have some familiarity here - I
tried using the same sort of approach with Google but can't get past the
authorisation- Am I banging my head against a brick wall here? Should it be
possible to authorise and download using
webclient.UploadData(url,&quot;POST&quot;,arrayofheaders) ? or should one be using a
webrequest()  - not sure I understand the subtleties.

 

3)      I am confused by the google documentation about authorisation - it
seems to have several ways of doing it - I'm trying to keep it simple with
just a client login but even in the documentation this bangs on a about a
'captcha' response = all serving to confuse

 

4)      I can find endless examples of python and php connecting to
Googledocs and even a few iOs examples but none very helpful unless you
understand those languages and as usual most of them are buried under layers
of abstraction.  Can anyone suggest some reading which might be more
appropriate to c#  and mandroid? Or has anyone done this and has some few
lines of  code for something as simple as getting a list of available files?
I find I learn mostly by example

 

TIA 

John M
