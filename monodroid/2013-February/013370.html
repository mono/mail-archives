<PRE>Yes I am on JB - funny thing is I developed this on a JB device, eve one
running 4.2 (or actually, 2... Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4), then also tested
on an S3 running 4.1.2 - and it worked as advertised on all three. Then I
pushed it out to my customer, who reported back that running the logcat
reader would freeze the app. 

After some back and forth and lots more debugging I was ready to push
another update and during my release testing I tested the logcat again with
my production apk and that's where I first saw the freeze. 

I figured the process wouldn't exit and started looking there, running the
logcat process in the background and dumping a whole lot of information to
logcat and listening to it from the developer console and it all working out
(except for the whole thing about Process.Exited which just never fires...
but logcat does run in all my debug builds, and it reads data (I have a
method extracting data I'm interested in and it also gives me a rundown of
how many logcat output lines were parsed... and I always do get stdout
lines).

So perhaps this is just a release mode thing (though.. does that concept
translate to java.. I don't even know how I'd generate a release or debug
build of my Java apps (all stuff meant for PCs, not Android)).

I'd have created a repro project but if it shouldn't be possible to read
logcat anyway.. what's the point (though when logcat runs in debug mode..
what's up with p.Exited not firing?).

Are there alternatives for crash logs? We've already established that
handling all the uncaught exception handlers isn't enough (that's what we do
with PC apps where it goes a long way to help understand things we cannot
repro in our own environment). My app has its own logging mechanism up and
including sending emails (which also had to be rewritten for JB as the mail
app suddenly can no longer access private files), but if the app crashes, it
would be nice to see the unhandled exceptions that goes through the cracks.

Stephan
