<PRE>Yes, I've read the warning label, and I know that dynamically loading assemblies is somewhat discouraged.  That said, I have an application that loads assemblies - that's just how it works.  It works fine on Windows.  Works fine on Windows CE.  I need it to &quot;work fine&quot; on Android, even if it takes some massaging.

Basically the app is an engine that loads up plug-in DLLs (we'll call it an Adapter) that meet specific interfaces at run time.  Under Windows, it even detects the appearance of a DLL at any point and goes and loads it - I'm fine if that's not going to work under Android.

What I'm having trouble getting working is having the Engine load an Adapter that it knew about at design/compile time but *without* hard coding the name of that Adapter into the Engine code.  I'm fine with adding a reference to the Adapter to get it to not get linked out, but I really, really don't want to have to add in the DLL name every time, as the DLLs change with different deployments, and that would lead to a huge headache.

So I figured that if it's referenced, it would get into the APK, and I could use reflection to load it like this:

var asm = Assembly.Load(&quot;TheAdapterName.dll&quot;);

Initial tests show that this works for the Adapter if I just hard code in the name, but again, I really, really want to avoid that.

So I thought that maybe I could reflect through the references and extract the name, but oddly, not all references actually show up when I do that.  So I do this:

var refs = asm.GetReferencedAssemblies().Select(a =&gt; a.Name).ToArray();

And I get back an array of 14 assembly names.  But the assembly (asm) has 16 references, one of which is the Adapter plug-in I need to load.  The Adapter is definitely there - heck I uses Assembly.Load with the full name two lines above and it resolved.

I thought, ok, maybe I can figure out the &quot;path&quot; to the folder from which I'm running, and then look for DLLs there and load that way.  Ha.  After several hours of trying to figure out a way to get the path that would work under Debug and Release, I came up with nothing but more grey hair.

Sooooo......  any thoughts on how I might get the name of a DLL that I know is in my APK, but that I don't &quot;know&quot; the name of at build time (I'm loading them and looking for interfaces via reflection to detect their &quot;Adapterness&quot;).

I'm stuck.
