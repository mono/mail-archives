I know how this is.  A couple of things to mention:1.  One of the Jonathans said that he was working on the debugger.  I've got some confidence that they will improve this.  Yeah, I know its a hassle for them at this point.2.  Do you have a mac?  If so, check out mono for android on the mac with mono develop.  I have found that debugging does work better on the mac than on windows.  I'm not quite sure why, but I think the emulator &quot;sucks less&quot; on the mac, which helps out in this situation.3.  Android development is just plain painful.  I've seen presenters have problems with Android development at conferences.  In talking to my android buddies, they have problems.  Remember, m4a is riding on top of the android infrastructure, so its hard to be better than Android is.  The best it can realistically do is &quot;suck slightly more&quot; than Java development on Android.

I have to agree whole-heartedly. I&#8217;ve not purchased this despite initially demonstrating some functionality on devices using the beta versions.  It would be suitable if it forced a load screen, or had a time limited operation without a license, but not being able to test and demonstrate the functionality properly in advance is a major challenge for getting sign-off on the product and development time.

Subject: Re: [mono-android] What Debugger isn't Slow? Thanks, your comments below are pretty much what I have come to accept as the reality of Android development.. Though Eclipse/Emulator isn't that bad, Mono/Emulator is impossibly slow.   Ximian needs to come up with a way to let us test drive on a device.. Because I promise they are loosing sales to slow emulator testing and the risk of investing in the product given the perceived performance via the emulator experience.. 

I know internally here it is a risk I am having discussions around with the people that sign the checks :-P Josh HandelSenior Lead Consultant512.328.8181 | Main512.328.0584 | Fax512.577-6568 | Cellwww.catapultsystems.com CATAPULT SYSTEMS INC.THE MICROSOFT CONSULTING COMPANYFrom: <A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodroid">monodroid-bounces at lists.ximian.com</A> [<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodroid">monodroid-bounces at lists.ximian.com</A>] on behalf of Richard Wilburn [<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/monodroid">rhwilburn at gmail.com</A>]

Subject: Re: [mono-android] What Debugger isn't Slow?I think ultimately what could help you the most is android x86 (this is not supported yet i beileve, but is probably more useful than many realise for people that don't own an android device). Android ARM is very slow in emulating (where as iphone has an awesome emulator).

I would also recommend developing against a phone u do have such as iphone, or windows phone (windows phone can be nicely emulated on windows) and then u can make sure u are only debugging android specific issues (minimizing your need for debugging). We are developing android first for our project however, but we use unit tests and physical devices where we can. Some of the android tablets coming out now are quite cheap, and could worth investigation.

As others have said, the android emulator is very slow. The best advice for speeding that up is to leaving it running for long periods of time. it does then cache alot of stuff and run faster (but still nastily slow). Im not convinced that a fast hard drive speeds it up, as i have a feeling that android simulators are probably translating cpu instructions and that is where the bottle neck lies. I also run a RAID 0 at home, and notice no difference in simultor speed really between that and non raid enviroments.

I would definately recommend that you make sure you rom size is over 1 gig because if the android simulator hits the max limit, it can corupt your android vm which u won;t notice. all it will do is not connect to the internet. Then if u restart emulator it complains its corrupted. Since i made my vm sizes over 1 gig i have never had that issue. I love android but their simulator is a very poor effort (the worst it could be while justifying its use) compared to windows phone and iPhone.

The hd speed can vastly effect such things as can the quality of your
ram. Trying looking at gaming machines. They are built for speed, and
coincidentally, faster debugging. I know the &quot;freeze&quot; in normal
development all too well.
