Just adding a note to this.  If anyone is basing their opinion on mfa on what applications do in the emulator, they really are doing the wrong thing.  The android arm emulator as it currently exists is a disaster.  I was at AnDevCon and the danged crashed on me more than once.  It was a disaster for everyone that presented.  I don't think I went to a single presentation where it didn't just downright crash at one point.  Would an x86 emulator do better?  I would think so, but I don't think google or mfa has the support up and down the toolchain for it yet.

A second issue is that honestly, google is dripping versions of ICS and the emulator out the door.  In the past 2 months, I have seen 2 revs of the sdk and who knows how many tools within the sdk change.  I have already been told to expect updates to the 4.0.3 emulator, so I have a feeling that more are coming out.

Another is that, honestly, the tools for Android are not very good.  They can get confused pretty easily.  ADB is problematic at best, but its all that exists until Xamarin re-engineers that toolchain, and that doesn't make a lot of sense.

Now, I honestly understand the frustration.  Its hard to based a discussion of mfa based on its own merits when its sitting there depending on such a shaky and ever changing infrastructure that is outside of Xamarin's control.  A lot of these problems exist in the java side as well from what I can see.

</I>&gt;<i> The only thing i wanted to think about is, will i learn 3 programming
</I>&gt;<i> languages or use 1 and reuse the code.
</I>&gt;<i> What gives it to me. More free time, less gray hair.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it is your opinion to use Java it is Ok invest the time. But for a firm
</I>&gt;<i> it could be better to spend the little money and use the skills what they
</I>&gt;<i> have inhouse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is everbodys own decision to use it or not. And to wait 20 to 30 seconds
</I>&gt;<i> to deploy on Emulator is ok. In hystorie you have waited for a frame of time
</I>&gt;<i> to use a computer to deploy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now you want it now, just in time. Is it not thinking the compiler will show
</I>&gt;<i> your mistakes?
</I>&gt;<i> Do you only monitor one problem or try you to combine the error testing?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The aim is to save time by using a language and his tools you know and i
</I>&gt;<i> think this is a good way in .Net direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if i look in Eclipse and Java, layout building is a great mess, after
</I>&gt;<i> 2-3 changes close and reopen the axml, debugger detach very often because a
</I>&gt;<i> direct connection to the ADB and AVD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like to work with monodroid it is not the fastest but if you test more
</I>&gt;<i> thinks at once you can minimize the time thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So my thinking at this time show me a better solution and it could change.
</I>&gt;<i> Java in this way is no way for me.
