<PRE>Answers to problems such as this are not as easy as some people think. Some 
people can use their intelligence to over-simplify the criteria. I know what 
it is like to be in the situation of having to choose between paying for food 
or tools. It is extremely easy for some people to ignore the situation that 
many others are in.

$400 is cheap for companies and many people. There are many developers like me 
that would be so very happy to pay that amount if we got that amount from 
sales of our software. Any implication that out intent is to avoid making a 
reasonable payment for the tool we use is ignoring some very critical points. 
I think that everyone would agree that if software were to result in a few 
hundred dollars of income and the person receiving the income were to avoid 
paying for the tools, then they would be jerks.

The problem is that software often costs the same whether someone uses it very 
rarely or for many hours every day. It is not so easy to determine what is a 
reasonable amount.
