<PRE>Thank you. According to their feature list most of these features are supported: <A HREF="http://www.basic4ppc.com/android/why.html">http://www.basic4ppc.com/android/why.html</A>
Seems like they are generating Java from the Visual Basic code. Anyway we will download and try both frameworks.

Subject: RE: [mono-android] Mono for Android versus Basic4android
 

 
Given its an in-house app, I would suggest you focus on what your developers are comfortable with first.. There is probably 40 ~ 80 hours of rampup to be near full developer velocity in Java, if you have .NET developers using Mono for Android will cut that down (1/2 to 1/4) because they aren't dealing with learning a new SDK and way of thinking AND a new Language.&#160; 

If your developers don't use .NET then the calculus changes slightly because you will have the burdon of learning a new language anyways.. 

However, one of the things I like about Mono[platform] is that you can leverage your code files across platforms.. But that doesn't sound like its hugely important to you.

As for Basic4Android, I would shy away from anything that doesn't do the following (I don't know if Basic4Android does or doesn't so, these are just my suggestions)

1) Allow you access to all Platform SDKs (MonoTouch and Mono for Android do this)
2) Allow you to incorporate third party libraries (its not trivial, but doable in both mono projects as well)
3) Allow you to debug (sounds silly, but try debugging PhoneGap, or the early versions of Titanium.. Actually try debugging Titanium now! :-P)
4) Allows you to build both AppStore and Enterprise apps
5) Has a floating seat.. After all you don't know which of your developers will be working on it, and we can never assume some 1 person will work for your company for ever.
6) Uses the native platform way of doing UI (uses native UI Controls, and hopefully native designers)

Hope that helps.

This is an in-house application that will run on dedicated devices. So Android is fine for now. Though we may want to add support for iPhone in the future.

Do you have any plans to support other platforms (WP7 or iPhone?)..

We are checking which of the above tools is easier for development of several Android applications.
Does anyone have any experience with both tools?
The first application should work with a local SQLite database and a remote database (by calling a custom web service written with PHP).
