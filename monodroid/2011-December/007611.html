<PRE>Hi to all,

i'm working on a porting some part of my applications (and, going on
all remaining parts) to C# with Mono for Android, because it's too
awesome!

I wrote some helpers in C, as standalone applications that runs
through privileged users using su (on rooted phones) or adb. The
problem is that these helpers are quite complex and need to
communicate with the rest of the application through a socket where i
send binary data ... i must replicate every change i make
everywhere!!!

I wrote in C an uinput wrapper, a frame buffer video server (right now
i output an mjpeg stream, but i want to use ffmpeg libraries to output
an mp4) and a native shell (pty) wrapper and i want to rewrite these
in C# because maintain all this code is quite complex :\

There is a way to use Mono for Android to compile some external C#
application (that doesn't need to access the android stuff)? And use
the mono for android installed on the phone to execute it?
Would be amazing :)

Thank you!

PS: i know that mono doesn't support mixed assemblies, but there is a
plan for them? Obiviously i can't compile an mixed mode assembly on
windows and think to run it on linux, but if i compile it on a
specific target i could run it on that target (i mean, if i cross
compile the code using android sdk the native code will use arm
instructions)


Best Regards,
Daniele
