<PRE>Jonathan,

That fixed it!

We only have one Android application, but we have multiple class library projects.  Somehow, one of the class libraries got marked as deploy for both RELEASE and DEBUG modes.  Why would a class library get recognized as deployable?

Either way, thank you!  That will save much time and irritation.  We've been ignoring it for the last few weeks, but I kept meaning to send an inquiry.  I'm so glad that I did!

Thank you again,

Chris Tossing
