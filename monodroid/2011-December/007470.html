<PRE>Hi,

        When compared to the cost of development man hour cost
(25-100$/hr) to develop apps, Mono for Android is Cheap (16-4 hrs).
Also note that the license is perpetual and only if you want to update
with the newer version because you want to enhance your application,
you need to renew.

         But I still agree with you that Barrier to entry should be
reduced and hopefully Xamarin address this. Only when more and more
apps get developed it will be better for everyone.

         One way to solve this issue may be to do Per App licensing
(5-25$) where any one can upload  a Mono for Android project and the
system will compile it using a Production Licensed and give back a
APK, which can be signed using their own key and be submitted to the
Market Place. This should not be done by anyone other than Xamarin
else we will be cannibalizing Xamarin Revenue.

         If you are prepared to develop using the Evaluation Version
(It is dead slow) and at some point if you zip and send me your
project files, I should be able to compile it using my production
license and send you a Production Deployable APK which you can resign
using standard jarsigner and submit it to the Market/deploy to your
device.

          If you want to protect any part of your code, then just
create a library project and submit only the dll reference in your
main project without the library source, but I think I need the full
project source (excluding the library source) to compile.

         This offer is open to everyone who want to see their
performance of Mono For Android App on an actual Device before buying
a Mono for Android License, but please don't misuse this to avoid
paying Xamarin their just dues. The more and more Xamarin makes money,
they can spend more and more on Resources to improve the product.

         I also hope that I am not violating any licenses in offering
this help to members of this community.
