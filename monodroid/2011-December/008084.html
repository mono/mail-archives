Yes

It always has been.

You make this sound like performance isn't an issue even in the platform native language. :-)

Performance may be an issue; it might not be. It depends on the app and myriad other factors, and you can still have performance issues even in the platform native languages. (This is why we have profilers...except that we don't, and that's something we are working on. ;-)

That said, I've rarely heard of Mono's overhead being an issue except during app startup in Mono for Android, which we have improved in 4.0 (cutting startup time in half), and in MonoTouch the entire program is ahead-of-time compiled, so there's no JIT overhead at all.

&gt;<i> 4.  Is deployment an issue?   in the sense,   even if you have develop  a 10kb application, still to install that you will consume more space ? how much more?
</I>
It depends. For Mono for Android, it's at least 2.9MB overhead:

The actual value depends upon what your app uses, and how much of the BCL can be linked away. If your &quot;10kb&quot; app uses System.Xml, System.Data, LINQ, and various other bits, you'll see the linked BCL size increase (so your app size will be larger than 2.9MB); it's largely pay-as-you-go.
