<PRE>Is anyone else seeing this?

This didn't always happen - this started about two weeks ago from last Friday (Dec 9, I believe).  Ever since then, we have had to wait through the packaging/deploy process twice every time we deploy to a device (I don't know if this happens with the emulator).

We are seeing this same behavior in two separate development environments using Win7 x64 with VS 2010 and Mono for Android 4.0.1.

Is it possibly something that changed in our project structure (or manifest file) which could be causing this?

Thank you,
