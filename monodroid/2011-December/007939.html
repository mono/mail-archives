<PRE>We have observed this strange memory behavior (rapid cycling up above 1GB of usage and then back down) on Windows 7, as well (we are using Win7 64-bit, in case it matters).

Another strange IDE behavior that we have seen is a need to deploy twice before it finally goes through (I know this has been happening on the device - I'm not sure if it happens on the emulator). This didn't always happen - it started a week ago Friday for me. Ever since then, though, we have had to wait through the packaging/deploy process twice every time. Any others see this? (if so, maybe Xamarin can help us identify what is causing it and get a fix into the next release)

Thank you,

Chris Tossing
