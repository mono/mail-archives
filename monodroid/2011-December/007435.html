<PRE>It is not normal that I post asking for something to be discounted but I
think in this case it is valid. I really like the Mono for Android concept
and I really want to support the project but for me the $400 price tag is
simply too much and I can not justify purchasing the product. As I develop
in C# it would be the ultimate solution for me.

I develop a free application and it is just too much to afford especially
considering it is only a years worth of support. So in a year I will have to
pay again.

I am writting this mainly to ask if you would consider another pricing tier
maybe at $200 so that people like me can purchase your product and not have
to look to learn java. Maybe you could also consider a Christmas sale? ;-)

I really like this product and really want to use it but at the moment you
are going to loose me as a customer.
