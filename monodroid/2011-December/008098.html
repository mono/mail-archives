<PRE>Looks like my code only looks for the existence of &lt;AndroidApplication&gt; 
and isn't checking the actual value.  (The class library template just 
doesn't have the element.)  I'll fix that up.

Thanks for the detective work to track this down!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That fixed it!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We only have one Android application, but we have multiple class library projects.  Somehow, one of the class libraries got marked as deploy for both RELEASE and DEBUG modes.  Why would a class library get recognized as deployable?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Either way, thank you!  That will save much time and irritation.  We've been ignoring it for the last few weeks, but I kept meaning to send an inquiry.  I'm so glad that I did!
