<PRE>The only thing i wanted to think about is, will i learn 3 programming
languages or use 1 and reuse the code.
What gives it to me. More free time, less gray hair.

If it is your opinion to use Java it is Ok invest the time. But for a firm
it could be better to spend the little money and use the skills what they
have inhouse.

It is everbodys own decision to use it or not. And to wait 20 to 30 seconds
to deploy on Emulator is ok. In hystorie you have waited for a frame of time
to use a computer to deploy.

Now you want it now, just in time. Is it not thinking the compiler will show
your mistakes?
Do you only monitor one problem or try you to combine the error testing?

The aim is to save time by using a language and his tools you know and i
think this is a good way in .Net direction.

And if i look in Eclipse and Java, layout building is a great mess, after
2-3 changes close and reopen the axml, debugger detach very often because a
direct connection to the ADB and AVD.

I like to work with monodroid it is not the fastest but if you test more
thinks at once you can minimize the time thing.

So my thinking at this time show me a better solution and it could change.
Java in this way is no way for me.
