<PRE>It actually has the line:

&lt;AndroidApplication&gt;false&lt;/AndroidApplication&gt;


I believe that it was, in fact, originally an Application project that got used as a class library.  (I was originally thinking I could use an Android application project as a &quot;Control Library&quot; of sorts - I ran into problems with that approach and abandoned it)

Wouldn't the above line indicate to the IDE that it is not deployable?

Thank you,

Chris Tossing

Hmm, class libraries shouldn't be deployable unless they have this line
in the csproj:

&lt;AndroidApplication&gt;true&lt;/AndroidApplication&gt;

Can you see if it has this line, and if so, was it originally an
application project that got used as a class library?

Thanks!
Jonathan
