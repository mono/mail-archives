<PRE>Hi,

1) Yes

2) Yes, always was a paid product.

3) On iOS, I never compared with Objective C since I don't have a Objective
C version but, MonoTouch generate Objective C and compiles it to native
Objective C application. I don't &quot;feel&quot; any performance issue on iOS on our
application.

4) We have a complex enterprise application with a LOT of resources, rules
configurable per client and things cross platform, with more than 40
Views/Screens/Forms and more than 40 tables on Sqlite. No issues to deploy
it on iOS. It have about 5MB and considering that we had to recreate many
features found on Windows Mobile that do not exists on iOS, like database
sync with SQL Mobile 2005 RDA (Remote Data Access) and real localization of
forms and country + language, as on Windows, 5MB is good. Weekly more
features are included and size do not appear to grow significantly. Windows
Mobile version after obfuscation has 1MB. It appear to be bigger but since
it's other platform, other kind of features, 5 MB is not being issue on more
than 1000 users. Since it's for enterprises, our application self manage
it's updates when needed and no problems (except normal problems like weak
Wifi or awful 3G connection but it happens too on Windows Mobile and
Android).

To us, MonoTouch is the only way to follow, considering native things and
other alternatives.

Subject:  [mono-android] Feedback, Developers Experience with the tool.

Hello Friends,

1.  To recap.. from what I understand is that this framework is now further
developed and maintained by the company Xamarin.   Yes/No?

2.  Its now a paid product  Yes/No ?

3. My friends say performance is an issue when you develop using non-native
language   ( eg. Java for android and objective-C for iphone.)
   How much is this true?  what is experience of this group who have live
app.

4.  Is deployment an issue?   in the sense,   even if you have develop  a
10kb application, still to install that you will consume more space ? how
much more?
     What are other practical issues group has experienced during live
deployment on user's mobile.

Regards
Jignesh.
