</I>Hi, Thanks for the clue!
I managed to work out that the problem was that onBackPressed() was being overridden and I was targeting a pre Android2 API (1.6 which does not have onBackPressed).   So the problem was not that I was not implementing all abstract methods but rather that I was trying to override a method that did not exist on the super type.  I changed this and that error is gone.

However my original problem still stands. For some reason the generated code for my NotifyingList&lt;T&gt; and subsequently BulletinBoardList which inherits from NotifyingList&lt;T&gt; do not compile in java.  All the C# code compiles fine so I assume that this is either a configuration error or a bug in mono for android somewhere.

Should I bother making a repro project and filing a bug or is this a known issue? I'm not clear about what is going wrong so searching for an existing issue is tricky.

Cheers,
Felix
