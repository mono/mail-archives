<PRE>If you seriously think 400 bucks is expensive you might want to find a new
line of work?  Because Database software for 25k is actually considered
cheap in this industry, look at how much Oracle charges for its software for
example.  After all is said and done you are looking at 100s of thousands of
dollars, the prices that Xamarin charge are extremely cheap and affordable. 
It costs a hell of a lot to hire talented developers, for adverstising,
marketing, and Xamarin also has to answer to their Angel Investors who
funded them, because they are in it for long term profit and so is Xamarin
(that is what a business is all about).  

If you work for a company unwilling to shell out this kind of money for a
toolset then they aren't really serious about the work from the start.  You
should seriously consider finding another place to work at, because all you
will find is grief.  If its your own business, here is a motto that I run my
business by &quot;You have to spend money, to make money&quot;.  Just like you have to
spend time, sweat, blood, you have to spend money.  Nothing in life is free,
and that includes success.

This forum is not the proper place for this mumbo jumbo, but I hope you take
this advice.  Asking for a discount, unless its promotional is the same as
asking them to do work for you...
