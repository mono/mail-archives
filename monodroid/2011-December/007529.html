<PRE>I tried to evaluate Monodroid a while back, and given that the demonstration
version is limited to the emulator and the emulator is effectively broken,
this means Monodroid is broken.

I have heard that deploying to an actual device is worlds better, but as I
can't actually test that myself I cannot say.  After the developer
experience I had with the simulator, there is no way I am going to take that
risk! I can't imagine I am alone on this.  Frankly you are probably better
served not having an evaluation at all than tying your experience to the
horrible emulator.


So my request is, is there any chance you can release a 15-30 day time
limited demo that can deploy to devices for development?
