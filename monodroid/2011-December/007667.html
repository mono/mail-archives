<PRE>I'm not too familiar with android programming and I've been reading
documentation&amp;trying out things with monodroid for 3 days (and still am not
getting anywhere) so I'll really appreciate if I can get any help from here.
Thanks.

Basically my problem is, I have quite a large amount of source code written
in C#, they are built into .dll libraries and the dll file is provided to
people who want to use its functionalities. Now I want to port this library
to Android so it can be used to develop android apps. Since it is in C#, I
thought Monodroid would be perfect for it. 

However, I would like the resulting file to be used for developers wrting
application in Java (afterall, thats the language most people use)

I realize that monodroid can generate 
<A HREF="http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/architecture/android_callable_wrappers">http://docs.xamarin.com/android/advanced_topics/architecture/android_callable_wrappers</A>
ACW  which is needed for Android runtime, does that mean, it actually
generate some Java code (and maybe I can take that and build them into a
JAR?)

It also says that Monodroid produce applications that 
<A HREF="http://support.xamarin.com/customer/portal/articles/140416-will-my-users-need-to-install-mono-">http://support.xamarin.com/customer/portal/articles/140416-will-my-users-need-to-install-mono-</A>
do not require users to install monodroid  because the mono mobile runtime
is linked to application, then does it mean I can produce a library file
that does not require developer to use monodroid to reference it? 

There is a post similar to my question but there is no practical answer
given: 
<A HREF="http://mono-for-android.1047100.n5.nabble.com/Calling-a-MonoDroid-library-from-native-Java-td4403364.html">http://mono-for-android.1047100.n5.nabble.com/Calling-a-MonoDroid-library-from-native-Java-td4403364.html</A> 
older post  - I know I can sorta use monodroid make the library class into a
Android library class and if I also use monodroid to write the andriod
application I can directly use this class - but what if I write the
application in java? I cannot reference a .dll in java right?

The summarized question is here: Can I use Monodroid to convert the C#
library to a JAR or any type of file that can be used by Android java
developers? If I can, how? 

And.. ew this is a lot of words.. if you can provide not a solution to my
problem but a few thoughts, please also say them out so I can investigate
about it some more.

Thanks!!!
