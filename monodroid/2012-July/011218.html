<PRE>Hi Jon

Thanks again for your reply.

&gt;<i>All data will always be out of date to some degree. (Consider: user
</I>launches app, sleeps the device, returns an hour later. Will your &gt;data be
updated? Should it be?) The question is, what is a reasonable boundary for
caching. You can always provide an explicit &gt;Refresh command if the cached
data is &quot;too old.&quot;

Sorry I should have worded this better. The solution that I have
implemented is exactly as you have described.

For the data caching this application could very much make use of caching
business objects. I am already using the ImageLoader cache for images which
caches a maximum of 50 images in memory at any one time.

The data in this app is grouped by days. At any one time the user will only
be viewing data for a selected day. How might I/should I go about caching
the business objects in terms of limiting the amount of objects in memory
at any one time to limit the amount of memory used? Do business objects
take up enough memory to even be concerned?

I have never really done any caching of plain objects so I am not too sure
on how I could/should measure the amount. The Image cache is simple as all
the images are the same in terms of their classification but with my
business objects there are relationships etc. that should be also be
persisted in the cache.

Are there any standard caching examples/libraries that have been written
for or used in Mono mobile apps?

Thanks Again
Liam

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - The data queue should take higher priority to the image queue. So the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - If the activity is destroyed before loading all of the data/images it
</I>&gt;<i> should dequeue any outstanding requests. Any ideas how I might dequeue if I
</I>&gt;<i> am using something like the ImageLoader from the MWC app?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately no.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What are your thoughts on this design for managing the requests?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This makes a lot of sense: centralize network access so that you can
</I>&gt;<i> prevent flooding. You could also implement a data caching layer here (so
</I>&gt;<i> for e.g. image data you check disk before sending the network request),
</I>&gt;<i> transparent to the caller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I still need to make individual requests for each activity as the data
</I>&gt;<i> retrieved from each request is specific to the individual activity and it
</I>&gt;<i> can only be retrieved on the per activity basis. I need to have realtime up
</I>&gt;<i> to date info for each activity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you? Really? :-)

</I>&gt;<i> 5s data cache. 5s isn't a terribly long time, and it supposedly had a large
</I>&gt;<i> reduction on database queries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If I initiate the all of the requests from the Application class as you
</I>&gt;<i> suggest and then raise the events to update the activities from the
</I>&gt;<i> application class when raising the event should it always be done on the UI
</I>&gt;<i> thread using SynchronizationContext.Post? Or is it ok to raise it on
</I>&gt;<i> another thread, then in the event handler in the Activity call
</I>&gt;<i> RunOnUIThread?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both sound appropriate; pick one and stick with it (to minimize confusion).
