Remember the primary rule of caching: A cache with a bad policy is another name for a memory leak:

Having a GC doesn't change this; if you have a &quot;cache&quot; with no mechanism/policy to remove items from that cache, you don't have a cache, you have unbounded memory growth. (Perhaps you need &quot;unbounded memory growth&quot; -- see XLinq, etc. -- just don't call it a cache.)

&gt;<i> The data in this app is grouped by days. At any one time the user will only be viewing data for a selected day. How might I/should I go about caching the business objects in terms of limiting the amount of objects in memory at any one time to limit the amount of memory used? Do business objects take up enough memory to even be concerned?
</I>
I don't know; I'm sure there are various patterns for this. One thing to keep in mind: if your business objects inherit Java.Lang.Object, directly or otherwise, their lifetime is automatically extended and they hold a gref. This may be intended/required; it's something you need to explicitly choose.

Given your requirement that the object graph contain relationships/etc., what may make more sense is to have a local disk &quot;cache&quot; of the XML/JSON/whatever you received from the server, and deserialize that data within the Activity that needs it. When the Activity dies, drop the object graph and recreate it when you need it again (assuming that the data is read-only and derived from the cached representation).
