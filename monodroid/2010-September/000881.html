I did the original updates to the protobuf-net source to add the initial
support for Mono and Silverlight [1,2] so am fairly familiar with the
process and while it's been a few months since I've spent any time working
directly with the source I'm finding myself with an immediate need for
protobuf-net support in Monodroid as well so I'll jump into it and see if
the necessary updates seem reasonable enough to put the work in directly
before chatting with Marc [Gravel] to see if he wouldn't mind taking over
(or sharing the load) with providing direct and ongoing support as he did
with both Mono and Silverlight once things were stable.

That said, if there are major architectural changes that end up needing to
be made (I doubt there will but won't know until I dive into the code) then
I'll have to chat with Marc about how he wants to proceed which could mean
holding off until the bits and pieces of Monodroid necessary to make things
a bit less painful are in place which will likely require shifting to a coop
strategy with those of us interested in support working back and forth
between both projects to ensure it's well understood where the issues exist,
fix and submit patches where we are able, and work to ensure a quick
turnaround of field testing changes made by either Marc or the Monodroid
team devs is done until things get to where they need to be.

I'll update again once I've got a better feel for the work involved with
getting things to build.
