<PRE>Hey Marc,

I decided to get caught up on sleep rather than push things too hard my
first day back after a three week hiatus, so while I do have a few checkins
related to the protobuf-net to Monodroid side of things they're mostly
related to getting things organized into a minimized solution which contains
only that which is needed as far as getting the protobuf-net library itself
compiled and running via Monodroid.  That said, as soon as I have a big
enough window this morning I'll push the current state to github as it's
probably best to keep things open and exposed for ease of evaluation and
comment to ensure that any contributions stay within the confines you feel
most comfortable with from both a project layout as well as the code files
themselves standpoint.  I'll exound what I mean by that once I've check
things in and can point to an example for review.

I'm in and out all morning, but the times I'm in I'll do my best to provide
as much info as I can to ensure you can continue forward unimpeded, or as
close to unimpeded as is possible when nearly a full work day and therefore
the difference between my morning and your evening activities disallow for
much crossover time to work with each day, but then again does software get
developed any other way?

Not that I'm aware of, so no point in spending any more time on a useless
topic that bears no resemblance to ANYONE's real world of daily development
practices... ;-)  More below...

One name: Jb Evain. Actual two names: Jb's[1] and his side kick Cecil[2] the
Great.

[1] <A HREF="http://evain.net/">http://evain.net/</A>
[2] <A HREF="http://github.com/jbevain/cecil">http://github.com/jbevain/cecil</A>

The specific details of Cecil as they stand on the official Mono site can be
found at: <A HREF="http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil">http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil</A>

Cecil on it's own can either be a joy to work with (I'm a big fan of digging
down into things using Cecil directly, but I can understand why others
prefer to stay a bit higher up the stack where they will happily trade a bit
more raw IL-manipulation power for what can often times be their sanity,
though even less dramatic and more directly significant is the proficiency
in which Cecil can be used when coupled with the wide variety of supporting
tools that have cropped up and taken on a life on their own at:
<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/mono-cecil/web/projects-using-cecil">http://groups.google.com/group/mono-cecil/web/projects-using-cecil</A> &lt; In
particular take a look at the

Assembly Manipulation

... section where you'll find reference to the Mono Linker[1] and Mono Merge
projects, both of which provide excellent descriptions that explain exactly
what they do in as few words possible.

[1] <A HREF="http://mono-project.com/Linker">http://mono-project.com/Linker</A>
[2] <A HREF="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/cecil/merge/">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/cecil/merge/</A>


&gt;<i> Specifically, I have an existing IL generation machanism, that currently
</I>&gt;<i> emits a dll targetting the MS .NET framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It may be worth taking a look at Cecil and the surrounding tool support, but
then again if not mistaken you wrote your code generator in XSLT and since
XSLT is God's native tongue it's tough for me to argue with the
justification for sticking with that in which was sent from as both the
truth, the way, and the light.

And that is where the ridiculous sermon and references of deity end and the
reality that depending on the job at hand there are far better tools readily
available that you may consider replacing the home brewed generator with.
The above links should provide more than enough food for fodder so I'll
leave you at it noting that myself or anyone else on this list who has
experience in this space is likely to find the opportunity to help out with
the protobuf-net project both an exclting and interesting opportunity, so
don't be surprised if people begin to peal from the wood work eager to help
wherever it seems they can be of assistance.

Oh, and worth noting (though most folks I know have long since made the
integration, Reflector[1] has now been extended to provide direct
integration with Visual Studio, and when coupled with the Reflexil plugin
[2] you may find you have most of what you need, at least for the initial
phases of investigation into the internals of the generated assembly,
directly at your fingertips inside the VS.NET IDE.

[2] <A HREF="http://sebastien.lebreton.free.fr/blog/">http://sebastien.lebreton.free.fr/blog/</A>

If not mistaken, Jb has a post on his blog that the developer of Reflexil
provides and extended overview of the process of using Reflector and the
Reflexil plugin to quickly and easily look inside, manipulate, and
regenerate a new peverified assembly from the result. I'll locate the link
and update accordingly.
