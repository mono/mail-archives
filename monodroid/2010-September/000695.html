I'm afraid I have no idea which types you're referring to.

Most of the types we added over Silverlight fall into three categories:

 1. Feature requests (System.Xml.dll, numerious System.dll additions)
 2. OpenGLES support via OpenTK.dll
 3. SQLite support via Mono.Data.Sqlite (which brings in ADO.NET)

(1) were added during the MonoTouch betas and release processes, as
people attempted to port their existing code to MonoTouch.  (Apparently
they either hadn't tried to port to Silverlight or didn't care about
Silverlight at the time.)  We added these types and assemblies as a
porting aid.

(2) is because we don't have a native XNA implementation (though there's
an XNA implementation which is built atop OpenTK, iirc).  This is
basically required.

(3) is because (originally) iPhoneOS 3.x included SQLite, as does
Android, so SQLite is part of the common platform.  We felt that
developers would find an ADO.NET provider for SQLite useful (and
superior to needing to write/include their own SQLite interop code or
skip the feature outright).

Then there's Mono.Android.dll and monotouch.dll, which are required for
native platform access.  Skipping them isn't really an option.
