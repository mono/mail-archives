That's a good start, but I'm not sure it really attacks the problem at its
heart which is specific to folks new to the project who wouldn't know to
look for the username and password as part of a release announcement and/or
they come into the group just before or just after a release and are
therefore left having to search around while scratching their heads
wondering why it isn't more obvious what the username and password is. Once
you've used it once the likelihood that it's now safely and happily cached
in your browser means the only time it would become an issue again is if a
need arises to change the password.

The only reason this has become somewhat of an issue all of a sudden is
directly related to watching Marc Gravell stumble around a bit yesterday
trying to figure out why he had access to the mailing list but not the
project bits. Like many of us, it wasn't immediately obvious that the
password had been sent as part of the list welcome letter which to me
suggests that the problem has much more to do with how the initial message
is communicated to the receiver than anything else.  Could these be
something as simple as changing the subject line to provide a better
understanding to the fact that the contents represents far more than a
typical welcome to the mailing list form letter?  Something like:

Welcome to the Monodroid Private Beta. User name and password, important
links and info, etc. Inside
