<PRE>I want to make sure I understand what &quot;first time&quot; means. 

 

If I simply move away and come back to the application I continue where I
was before and still see the click count. I can, in fact, come back after
running apps. But eventually that seems to expire (I don't know the exact
rules) and it needs relaunch the application and things become painfully
slow again (with 12 seconds being an underestimate by far - I'm still
waiting after turning the screen back on ... and eventually it did start.)

 

It's as if the unpacked runtime gets uncached. Is there a way to explicit
retain the unpacked version, especially with the Samsung which has gigabytes
of storage in every nook and cranny. I presume if I have two monodroid apps
they share the same unpacked runtime?

 

BTW, in researching this I noticed that the prototype (Activity1) doesn't
show up in the application list. 

 

As long as things are slow there should be a splash screen or something to
tell the user that the program is not dead and, in fact, making progress.
The old MOTD trick to cover slow process launch.

Hello,

I downloaded the simple &quot;hello&quot; app to my phone. It took about 12 seconds to
put up the &quot;click here&quot; button on my Galaxy S (Samsung Vibrant).

 

This happens the first time the application is launched as it needs to
&quot;unpack&quot; the Mono runtime.   Future invocations do not have this problem.
