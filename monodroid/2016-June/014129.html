There&#8217;s a fine line between a &#8220;fix&#8221; and &#8220;hides the symptoms of the actual problem.&#8221; :-)

&gt;<i> Plus we allow almost all of our classes to be overridden by the user if they need to do so.  Maybe in this case MvxRecyclerViewHolder
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't need to use the constructor.  It's hard to tell when it is needed.

To me, there are only two circumstances in which you should provide the activation constructor:

1. You&#8217;re subclassing Android.App.Application or Android.App.Instrumentation.
2. You&#8217;re subclassing a Java type that contains virtual methods, and the constructor of the Java type can invoke those methods.

(2) is harder to narrow down, other than a blanket &#8220;Android.Views.View *might* require the activation constructor.&#8221;

This almost certainly does *not* describe `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`, as the only virtual (non-`final` instance) method it has is `Object.toString()`:

	<A HREF="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.ViewHolder.html</A>

&gt;<i> As far as I can tell Dispose() is not being called on MvxRecyclerViewHolder.
</I>
Normal GC finalizer behavior would also qualify. (I should have thought of that  before&#8230;) Once the Mono GC has finalized an instance, `Object.Handle` is null, and there&#8217;s no GREF to keep the Java instance alive. Consequently, `Object.finalize()`/`Object.JavaFinalize()` can be invoked on that instance&#8230;an instance which *can&#8217;t* be associated with anything meaningful (short of Reflection-fu) &#8212; because `Object.Handle` is null! &#8212; and now, 5 years on, I wonder why I ever bound that method in the first place&#8230;

Hm&#8230;.

I think the docs describe what the Activation constructor is *for* reasonably well. A related topic would be, what&#8217;s the problem with providing the activation constructor?

Alternatively, how would providing the activation constructor &#8220;hide the symptoms of the actual problem&#8221;?

Let&#8217;s take an IRunnable implementation:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/5777337/src/Mono.Android/Java.Lang/Thread.cs#L11-L54">https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/5777337/src/Mono.Android/Java.Lang/Thread.cs#L11-L54</A>

Notice that it *doesn&#8217;t* have an activation constructor. This isn&#8217;t for lack of people asking for one (on many types!), because an exception was thrown because the activation constructor doesn&#8217;t exist:

	<A HREF="https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=27408">https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=27408</A>

Yes, not having an activation constructor can cause a NotSupportedException/MissingMethodException to be thrown. The fix *isn&#8217;t* to add the activation constructor.

The fix is to figure out why we were trying to use the activation constructor in the first place. In the case of Bug #27408 it was due to a bug in our handle management (multithreaded code is hard!).

Adding the activation constructor would have &#8220;fixed&#8221; that bug. It also means we&#8217;d have had ~no way to even know that something was wrong, and no way to reason about a fix.

I don&#8217;t want a platform that cargo-cults around bug fixes with no understanding of *why* things are happening. I&#8217;m trying to keep the cruft low, the &#8220;it works if I do *this* but I don&#8217;t know why&#8221; crap to a minimum.

Not that I&#8217;m always successful, but I *really* don&#8217;t want to hide bugs. I want them found, a bright light shone on them, and the bug exterminated with extreme prejudice. Adding activation constructors &#8220;everywhere&#8221; is anathema to this.
