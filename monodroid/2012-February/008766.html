<PRE>Im an android user and I have (non-developer) complaints about large apps. 

 

I have a HTC Desire (aka Nexus 1) which is a great phone but HTC saw fit to
endow(read cripple) it with only 148 MB of internal storage.  This is enough
for a dozen or so apps so Im at a point where if I want to install something
I have to uninstall something first.  I can move apps to the SD but that
doesn't completely solve my problem.  I also only use apps that haven't got
a mobile web site alternative (eg I don't install facebook or google+, IMDB
my banks app and so on)

 

Just pointing out that app size can be one of the most important
considerations for choosing apps (it's the first thing I look at when
browsing an app in the market)

Subject: Re: [mono-android] size of apk

 

This is one of those interesting areas.  I have never had an end user
complain about application size.  The only user type that has ever
complained about an app size is another developer user, which isn't accurate
view of your userbase.  There is a legitamate worry with apk size, there is
a limit on the download size over cell networks.  I think the generally
accepted download size is 20 megs over cell and 100 megs over wifi, but that
may only be apple.  
 
Why is the market reporting 12 megs, I'm not sure.  Never have paid
attention to it.
 
The application size is not something to *typically* worry about regarding
performance.  This is a myth in computer programming, assuming that the size
is due to features.  Typically size is associated with features.  A more
worrisome issue is something called a working set size of an application -
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set_size.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set_size.</A>  Working set size is more a
product of the use of good algorithms instead of programming language.  I
remember writing applications in VB that performed better than C++ apps in
the late 90s.  Now, this isn't true in every situation, and no, I am not the
awesome programmer that knows everything.  I do tend to obsess over my
algorithms.  Picking a good algorithm tends to overcome the language used.

Subject: [mono-android] size of apk

I recall some time ago a thread about this - the size of Monodroid apks -
cant seem to find it.

I have  a reviewer making an issue of the size - strangely Android Market is
reporting it at 12mb whereas the apk I uploaded was only 6mb 

Anyway I seem to recall that this whole area is a bit misleading because the
mono apk contains stuff which is not necessarily all loaded into memory ??
or do I remember that right ? Does the whole apk 6mb translate into a 6mb
footprint in memory ? Are there any other ripostes to critics of the package
size ?
