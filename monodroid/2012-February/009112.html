&gt;<i> Yes they can be, but the examples from the book aren't, nor are the ones from FlightsNorway. If they /are/ in the same solution, it doesn't help refactoring at all, because there are two separate project hierarchies: refactoring Library.Droid will change the files in App.Droid, and also in Library.MT (because the are the exact same files as Library.Droid), but it wont do the refactoring in App.MT. So, they might as well be in separate solutions. And in fact, having them all in the same solution /completely fucks up Intellisense/ and Resharper's Code Dom. Whole Solution Analysis (in R#) that I totally rely on to make sure my MT projects will actually compile when switch to the Mac, is completely broken by having the same file in two different projects.
</I>Sounds like a feature request for JetBrains.

</I>&gt;<i> The MT app can be in the same solution, btw. You just need something &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/jamiebriant/VsMono">https://github.com/jamiebriant/VsMono</A>&gt;to fool VS into loading it, and a hacked version of monotouch.dll that claims to be .NET 4. Then you can use R# Solution Analysis to catch errors as you type: if R# says there are no errors, MonoDevelop will compile it on the Mac 99.99% of the time. I edit my MT apps on windows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I think I'll have to do that (are there step by step instructions somewhere?).  My brain hurts trying to learn all the different keybindings on the mac despite having hacked as many as possible.  I use the alt-&lt;firstletter&gt; key mnemonics in windows all the time and that plays merry hell on a mac!
