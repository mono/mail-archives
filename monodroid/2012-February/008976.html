<PRE>Running Windows 7 x64, VS 2010, latest service packs etc.. I installed an ssd
drive and wanted to change certain file locations so I uninstalled
monodroid, monodevelop and a few other programs.

Move what I need to around and everything works great. do to install
monodroid and says it's already installed along with all the components. So
I clean out all registry information I could find from monodroid as well as
any files I could find related in appdata/ try again same thing already
installed.  uninstall gtk. still says I have everything installed. so I go
ahead and download gtk install it, install monodevelop, try monodroid and
still thinks everything is installed. I think you get the picture that no
matter what component I have installed, uninstalled, etc.. it always thinks
everything is installed even though the components them selves such as gtk,
monodevelop are installing and uninstalling fine (I even removed their
directories and tried installing monodroid).

Not sure what I am missing to get monodroid to install again the log wasn't
much help as it just says everything is there even when they are not.
