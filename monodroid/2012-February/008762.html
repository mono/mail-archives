This is one of those interesting areas.  I have never had an end user complain about application size.  The only user type that has ever complained about an app size is another developer user, which isn't accurate view of your userbase.  There is a legitamate worry with apk size, there is a limit on the download size over cell networks.  I think the generally accepted download size is 20 megs over cell and 100 megs over wifi, but that may only be apple.   Why is the market reporting 12 megs, I'm not sure.  Never have paid attention to it. The application size is not something to *typically* worry about regarding performance.  This is a myth in computer programming, assuming that the size is due to features.  Typically size is associated with features.  A more worrisome issue is something called a working set size of an application - <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set_size.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set_size.</A>  Working set size is more a product of the use of good algorithms instead of programming language.  I remember writing applications in VB that performed better than C++ apps in the late 90s.  Now, this isn't true in every situation, and no, I am not the awesome programmer that knows everything.  I do tend to obsess over my algorithms.  Picking a good algorithm tends to overcome the language used. Wally

Subject: [mono-android] size of apk



I recall some time ago a thread about this &#8211; the size of Monodroid apks &#8211; cant seem to find it.I have  a reviewer making an issue of the size &#8211; strangely Android Market is reporting it at 12mb whereas the apk I uploaded was only 6mb Anyway I seem to recall that this whole area is a bit misleading because the mono apk contains stuff which is not necessarily all loaded into memory ?? or do I remember that right ? Does the whole apk 6mb translate into a 6mb footprint in memory ? Are there any other ripostes to critics of the package size ? John Murray
