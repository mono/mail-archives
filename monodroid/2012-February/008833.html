<PRE>Lee,

I had the opposite experience. I had (what we thought was) 95% of my iPhone app written in MonoTouch, and they were hassling me about an Android version. I mucked around one Saturday morning, got fed up with the simulator so went out and bought an Android phone, purchased Mono for Android, and by Sunday night I had a fully functional app up and running - only missing things like Badges on the tabs that I can't see an equivalent for. And this was nearly a year ago too, so it's not the most recent and much more bug free version of MfA either.

I don't think it's anything to do with being smart or not smart enough - I'm wondering what roadblocks you hit? Some things took me a bit of finding, but I found them in the end.

Dino

All of a sudden I had 4 days to come up with a proof of concept Android app working on device.  Only problem is I had never touched Android development.  In fact I had never even used an Android device before (typical crazy developer assignment right?).  Oh and by the way, I've never coded in Java.

So I figure my best shot was Monodroid since I have a C#/.NET background.

I spent a full day with M4A, and gave up due to roadblocks.  Spent the next day from scratch with only the Android SDK, and actually have all the basics of my app working on device.

What's wrong with this picture?  If the problem is I'm not smart enough then shouldn't the native option have been harder?

Lee
