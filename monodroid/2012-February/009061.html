<PRE>Hello All,

 

Figured I'd share my experiences with getting my app out for the NOOK which
is now available:  <A HREF="http://logbookpro.com/bn/nook">http://logbookpro.com/bn/nook</A>

 

This is probably the most painful and extensive application and submission
process I've gone through as compared to Apple and Amazon.  The Barnes &amp;
Noble NOOK developer account and app submission process is done in four
steps:

 

1)      Apply for a developer account - approval required before you can
proceed

2)      Submit your Bank/Tax information - they actually compare it with
what is on file with the IRS - approval required before you can proceed

3)      Submit the meta data for your app (everything except the apk file).
They were more strict in what I could write, i.e. I had to remove the part
that my app requires a cloud sync subscription to have the app share data
with the PC even though it has nothing to do with the app 

4)      Finally the APK could be submitted and then approved

 

The first two steps took WEEKS!!!  The last two steps only took 2-3 days
each.  You have to include screenshots of the dimensions for the NOOK, I did
that using their emulator config file.

 

The Barnes &amp; Noble developer portal is pretty nice, I especially like that
they have the &quot;plugin&quot; for the Android emulator to allow you to test with
their device image, size, etc. 

 

So be forewarned, it's a long process and four phases to go from start to
published app.  Pay attention to all the guidelines such as the app icon for
the web site (300x300px) has to have a backcolor, cannot be transparent (
your .png is inspected ) etc.

 

Thank you Xamarin!!!  It's great to be able to have such a wide reach using
the Mono* tools.
