I have folded M and C in MVC, M and P (in MVP) into one project - in 
other words everything
that has nothing to do with UserControls, Controls, Widgets, Forms, 
layouts, etc...

</I>In our case MVVM is not heavily used, because AFAIK it is based on Data 
Binding and
this is not (yet) part of M4A, MTch (WinForms in xaml sense) etc..
So for 3 project types (where one has 2% market) it does not pay-off - yet.

We'll start using it when I get more time to learn about Your 
baby-project MVVMCross.
