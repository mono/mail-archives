<PRE>Hello all, I'm just starting out with MonoDroid development (and Android 
development in general), and am just trying to get the Hello World 
tutorial to build, but I'm having a heck of a time just doing that. For 
some reason, whenever I try to run the app in Visual Studio (after 
everything's been installed), things seem to be working... the emulator 
starts (I had a bit of trouble getting even that far--the emulator was 
for some reason defaulting to the wrong disk) and Visual Studio copies 
the MonoDroid runtime to the device. This appears to work because I can 
see it in the installed Applications on the device.

However, when it tries to copy the application, it tells me there is not 
enough space on the device! This is for the tiny little default program 
in the project so I can't understand how it can copy the 20 meg runtime 
and not the app! Here's the exact error: &quot;There is not enough storage 
space on the device to deploy package.  Free up some space and try again.&quot;

Looking in the /bin folder I see a few files: my main project .dll file, 
which is 6 K, but then there are a couple .apk files that are roughly 12 
megs... what is this, and why is it so huge?

I set the SD card size on the emulator to a gigabyte, yet still get this 
error. I can't figure it out.

Thanks for any help!

Logan
