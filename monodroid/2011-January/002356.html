<PRE>My 2 cents is that I really need Monodroid to be a solid, up-to-date
foundation for my apps.  I'm making a choice to develop with it and it'd be
very difficult for me if it disappeared, was buggy or couldn't keep up with
Android releases (e.g. I'd love to have support for Android 3.0 soon, as I'm
hoping to develop for the Android 3.0 tablets that have been announced as
shipping this quarter), etc.

So I'd be willing to pay $300 or more to keep Monodroid solid and current.
 If it doesn't stay solid and current, then I'd stop using it and take the
time to learn and use other technologies and it wouldn't matter if the price
for Monodroid was $50 or free.

If they made Monodroid free or low cost for binaries, a bit more money for
source and additional money for support, that'd be fine with me.

BTW, I really, really appreciate the Monodroid team's efforts.  I think they
should earn a reasonable amount of $$ for their work.  Ideally Microsoft
would be paying them to create this product, as it definitely benefits
Microsoft to spread C# / .NET to other platforms, but my understanding is
Microsoft isn't currently offering much support.

Thanks -Bob
