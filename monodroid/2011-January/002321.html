<PRE>I do not get the never ending asking for price drops, special offers, 
discounts for licences of different product and such. I'm posting this 
to MonoDroid discussion, but it applies to MonoTouch and other in general.

1) MonoTouch is cheap, 400 USD for the comfort of writing and app in C# 
and not needing to hassle with XCode and Objective C is just plain 
blessing. I have done several projects in Objective C and zombie hunting 
and memory leaks fixings took much longer than 400 USD in time. Trust me.

2) MonoDevelop used for development is for free! What more could we 
want? It is not the best, but for sure not the worst. Visual Studio 2010 
is paid (the Express edition joke I do not take seriously), MSDN 
Subscription costs MUCH more...

3) MonoDroid is taking shape to be excellent, the same as MonoTouch, in 
its own good. Having a license of MonoTouch has nothing to do with that. 
Miguel and his guys do lots of work for rest of us to be comfortable and 
just use it, so to pay for the work they put in this, is more than fair.

4) Taking in mind that there are no competitive products such as 
MonoDroid and MonoTouch, 400 USD is a nice price. Check Unity for 
example, much pricier for 3000 USD (good as well though).

5) And they will bring us the MonoMac... come on, we have to support them.

And before you ask, no I do not have Novell shares, am not their 
employee or contractor (although I would not mind :-)), I do not take 
and didn't take any incentives, I just live from coding and software 
development and am fed up with constant pressure for lower pricing.

Just my two cents.
