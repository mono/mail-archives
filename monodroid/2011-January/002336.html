<PRE>As a MonoTouch developer I would hope there is a bundle discount.  I had to
fight to pay the $999 per developer to license the Enterprise version.  It
really hits hard for a small dev shop like mine.  We are having to ramp up
developers two months at a time to spread out the license fees in our penny
pincher economy.

I would love to see a device limit license model.  I think MonoTouch could
use that too.  Maybe a per developer price based on the number of devices
you wish to deploy to.  Therefore you hit the educational market, the small
dev shop building proof of concept applications, and the marketplace
developers.

So for example:

1 - 10 devices $99
11 - 50 devices $299
51 - 500 devices $499
Unlimited $999

Make it so that a developer can increase the license by paying the
difference to up the user count.  This breaks down the cost barrier.  I know
it makes licensing more difficult, but it makes adoption easier.  It is much
easier for me to get your product in the door of my dev shop at a $99 fee.
Show off what it can do and then ratchet up the license when my VP goes gaga
over the efficiency of using your tool.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; I do not get the never ending asking for price drops, special offers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discounts for licences of different product and such. I'm posting this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to MonoDroid discussion, but it applies to MonoTouch and other in
</I>&gt;<i> general.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) MonoTouch is cheap, 400 USD for the comfort of writing and app in C#
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and not needing to hassle with XCode and Objective C is just plain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blessing. I have done several projects in Objective C and zombie hunting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and memory leaks fixings took much longer than 400 USD in time. Trust me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) MonoDevelop used for development is for free! What more could we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want? It is not the best, but for sure not the worst. Visual Studio 2010
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is paid (the Express edition joke I do not take seriously), MSDN
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Subscription costs MUCH more...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) MonoDroid is taking shape to be excellent, the same as MonoTouch, in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its own good. Having a license of MonoTouch has nothing to do with that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Miguel and his guys do lots of work for rest of us to be comfortable and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just use it, so to pay for the work they put in this, is more than fair.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) Taking in mind that there are no competitive products such as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MonoDroid and MonoTouch, 400 USD is a nice price. Check Unity for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example, much pricier for 3000 USD (good as well though).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) And they will bring us the MonoMac... come on, we have to support
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And before you ask, no I do not have Novell shares, am not their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; employee or contractor (although I would not mind :-)), I do not take
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and didn't take any incentives, I just live from coding and software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development and am fed up with constant pressure for lower pricing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just my two cents.
