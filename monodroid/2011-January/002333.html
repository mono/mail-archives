<PRE>IMHO, it's just not fair to the MonoDroid or MonoTouch or MonoMeego teams to embrace their hard work by renewing fruitless discussions concerning what is commercial or not. It's rather straightforward:

1) you want a free development environment and toolchain for Droid? Easy, go to Google, sign up, download!  Dto. at Apple. Or Microsoft, really cheap. We're talking roughly 300 bucks to cover all three of those platforms.

2) you want to composite those platforms and really leverage your patterns using a premium tool such as MonoDroid/Touch/Meego is going to be another Grand on top of that.

That is certainly not &quot;cheap&quot; by any standards. I am however agreeing with with Pavel completely. I too have spent years on method 1) on several platforms, very costly indeed. I spent every cent on my Mono licenses happily (quietly thanking Novell that it doesn't cost more but still happy if so). The overall cross platform gain is enormous, trust me too. For the first time in my mobile development life, I'm ahead of my deadlines and my output quality has increased by at least an order of magnitude. If I were at Novell hell would freeze over before I gave that away for free when given an alternative to finance that experience over an extended period of time. I want it to get better with every release and, because I'll be relying on it for a living, I want    to be able to hire expert outside services in an emergency. All that costs money. Buy a license.

Some apps are going to generate revenue, others not. That's going to depend on a lot more than just the price of the toolchain. I say we not transport that discussion for  the Mono teams to consider, as they have work enough cut out for them already.
