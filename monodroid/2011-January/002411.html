I can't speak to specifics.  I can speak to my workflow.

My (personal) problem with web forums is that I (almost) never check them.  I forget they exist.

I check email, and even if I put it off for a few hours the email will still be there when I get back.  It's *hard* for me to forget about email.  It's downright trivial for me to forget about web sites (perhaps showing that visiting some of them isn't as deeply ingrained as it should be?).

In theory, if said web-based forum had an email interface, that could work.

In practice, I haven't seen one that actually works.  For example, take stackoverflow: in order for stackoverflow to fit into _my_ current mental workflow, I would like them to send me an email for, say, all new questions that have 'monodroid' as a tag.

I can't find such an option, and the only email options I *do* see are to get a *weekly* [0] email on questions that I've flagged or already answered...which doesn't actually make their email options useful to me.

That said, once we've released 1.0 I (personally, not speaking for the team) think that monodroid-related questions should be asked on stackoverflow...and I'll try to change my mental workflow to support that.  But for pre-release questions about why the emulator is so slow, or questions about bugs, or design discussions, or...  None of those seem appropriate for stackoverflow.
