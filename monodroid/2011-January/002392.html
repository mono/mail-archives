<PRE>&gt;<i> 2.2 *what*? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
2.2 Emulator image, and R8 of the toolchain, which is.... um.....

FFS. :(

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot we can do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK. If the bug you guys have submitted applies to this, I'll watch it
and change when it's fixed. I thought, as I _thought_ I had only 2.2
and not 2.3 of _anything_, that the perf should be ok. I guess not....


&gt;<i> If you're talking about the emulator image and not the toolchain, that's somewhat expected. &#160;The iPhone simulator is a *simulator*, running compiled x86 code. &#160;The Android emulator is an actual ARM emulator.
</I>

yes, just the emu. Everything else is fine I think - or rather, fine enough.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pro: You can take your single ARM-compiled .apk and install it on *both* the emulator *and* hardware. &#160;This isn't possible with the iPhone development environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Con: The emulator isn't all that fast.
</I>
yeah, that'll be it. I'll have a tweak around with my settings, and
put up with it. I've not used it much, so I had no point of reference
as to how good it was ment to be.

&gt;<i> However, an followup question is this: how do you exit the app so that you can have a &quot;second run&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yeah, good point. I was just hitting the icon in the apps, which is
most likely more just switching to the app, not rerunning it :) Damn
multitalking!

Thanks for the explanation. Having just learned iOS dev, I realise I
have a LONG way to go with Android stuff :)

&gt;<i> Again, normal. &#160;Android has a ~5s timeout before it shows the &quot;this app is taking too long&quot; message, and in the emulator it's not difficult to exceed that timeout (especially during first launch). &#160;Funnily enough, I've seen the same message for Android-included applications (further evidence that the emulator isn't all that fast). &#160;Things tend to behave much better on actual hardware.
</I>
Thanks Jon - I think a device might be in my future..... just gotta
convince the client to pay for one :) I have enough phones already, so
the CFO (wife) isn't buying it that I need another one....

Cheers

Nic
