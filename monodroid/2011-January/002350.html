<PRE>Hello Matt,

 Same me as Keith.  It will be a long time before I create an app I would
&gt;<i> charge more than 65 cents for.  Right now my only significant app was build
</I>&gt;<i> with App Inventor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Like somebody suggested on my blog, people might be charging *65 cents* for
their app, but they are expecting to sell a million.

How you monetize your work will depend on the market segment that you enter.
  In the mobile space there are many reasons to enter: to complement an
existing service offering (a client to your cloud service), to complement
your software suite (client software to your server software), to make money
with a standalone application, to bring your particular vision of a solution
to an existing problem, to create an entire market segment or as a hobby.

Each of those will have different monetization needs (or might not even have
a monetization strategy).   Some will be truly awe inspiring, hard
applications that are so unique that they can be priced very high and people
will pay for it, or they are useful only to a very small segment of users.
Many of you will consider pricing your application to reach a large volume
of users (99 cents for example) or because you are undercutting an existing
offering, or you want to gain mass use.   Others will choose to fund the
development through ads.

And that is just the beginning.    We looked at these scenarios ourselves
last year with MonoTouch, and we picked a licensing scheme that worked for
us.   It is not perfect, and it wont satisfy every possible need that can be
envisioned on the mailing list, but we feel that we balanced out properly
the pricing for the kind of support that we were offering.

You really can not show up at the Apple Store and get a Mac for free, and
only pay Apple based on how successful you were using your Mac.  Or whether
it helped on your work or not.   We can not carry the burden for every
developer that wants to venture into building mobile applications and might
not have a sound idea, or a sound execution team, or a sound marketing plan,
or might be pushed out of the market by their competitors.   That is a risk
that every development team needs to take on their own.

We hope that MonoDroid/MonoTouch will be useful for you, and we give out
evaluation versions for people to try out and determine whether this is
something that will help them be more productive, port more code, have more
fun.   If you like it, and you want to publish apps, you will have to buy a
copy.   If you do not like it, there are always alternatives.

Miguel
