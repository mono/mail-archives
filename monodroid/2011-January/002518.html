<PRE>Suggestion: To save others this learning experience, especially when apps
are being sold, it would useful for the runtime to at least one people of
the problem and other similar limitations.

Subject: Re: [Monodroid] Unable to Debug on Device

 

I just went back through the preview notes and saw the issue with the
samsung release of the 2.1 kernel. Lucky me! I suppose I will have to go get
a different device then. Is there a 2.2 device that other folks have had
good success with (win7 64)?

 

Thanks,

Oh Really? I didn't know that. I'm trying to debug on a galaxy s (which is
2.1). I finally got past the connection problem, but now it keeps throwing a
System.TypeInitilization exception when I start the hello world app. What
versions of the OS are supported? I guess I didn't see this in the docs.

 

Thanks for the reply,

Subject: [Monodroid] Unable to Debug on Device

 

Given how slow the emulators seem to run, I've been trying to debug on an
actual android device (Galaxy S). I got the drivers all installed and the
app provisions out to the device, but I can not get the debugger to attatch.
Debug mode is set to 'on' in the device settings. In the logs, I keep
getting &quot;Error connecting stdout and stderr&quot;. The device is on the same
network as the dev machine, and I've tried the static IP/port configuration
(as outlined in the monodroid docs) and the dynamic ones. No matter what, I
can not seem to successfully debug. I've also tried it on a HTC Evo 4g, and
that had the same result. I've disabled the firewall on my box, and nothing
seems to make a difference. The app flashes up for a second, and the
dissapears. If I manually run the app (it takes a few tries), it will
eventually start on its own (free of the debugger).

 

Note that debugging on the emulators works perfectly aside from the speed
and stability problems there.

 

Any ideas?

 

-Aaron
