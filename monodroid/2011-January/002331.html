<PRE>
I personally have no problem paying the licence fee so long as I can fully test it out on a real device beforehand.  I do think however that many indie developers will think twice before spending $400. Making a free version for non commercial use would encourage those developers to try it out. Remember the next crop of budding developers are probably still in high school where $400 is still quite a lot of money.
Given that MonoTouch is already out there at a similar price I would assume that the dev team will have a good idea whether that pricing model has worked for them or not. My guess is that MonoDroid is going to be more appealing to larger corporations building enterprise software so it is possible that a lot of income could come from licencing to those companies, thus making it possible to offer a cheaper version to individuals.
I don't think you can really compare unity as that is specifically tailored towards gaming and offers many things that MonoDroid doesn't.

There's no doubt that MonoDroid could be huge and it is worth $400, but I definitely think its worth the dev team thinking about the licencing model they offer so as to encourage the widest adoption.

</I>&gt;<i> I do not get the never ending asking for price drops, special offers, 
</I>&gt;<i> discounts for licences of different product and such. I'm posting this 
</I>&gt;<i> to MonoDroid discussion, but it applies to MonoTouch and other in general.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) MonoTouch is cheap, 400 USD for the comfort of writing and app in C# 
</I>&gt;<i> and not needing to hassle with XCode and Objective C is just plain 
</I>&gt;<i> blessing. I have done several projects in Objective C and zombie hunting 
</I>&gt;<i> and memory leaks fixings took much longer than 400 USD in time. Trust me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) MonoDevelop used for development is for free! What more could we 
</I>&gt;<i> want? It is not the best, but for sure not the worst. Visual Studio 2010 
</I>&gt;<i> is paid (the Express edition joke I do not take seriously), MSDN 
</I>&gt;<i> Subscription costs MUCH more...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) MonoDroid is taking shape to be excellent, the same as MonoTouch, in 
</I>&gt;<i> its own good. Having a license of MonoTouch has nothing to do with that. 
</I>&gt;<i> Miguel and his guys do lots of work for rest of us to be comfortable and 
</I>&gt;<i> just use it, so to pay for the work they put in this, is more than fair.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Taking in mind that there are no competitive products such as 
</I>&gt;<i> MonoDroid and MonoTouch, 400 USD is a nice price. Check Unity for 
</I>&gt;<i> example, much pricier for 3000 USD (good as well though).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) And they will bring us the MonoMac... come on, we have to support them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And before you ask, no I do not have Novell shares, am not their 
</I>&gt;<i> employee or contractor (although I would not mind :-)), I do not take 
</I>&gt;<i> and didn't take any incentives, I just live from coding and software 
</I>&gt;<i> development and am fed up with constant pressure for lower pricing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just my two cents.
</I>&gt;<i>
