<PRE>If I may chip in my two cents, I'm a professional developer (not for mobile
phones, but other embedded systems), and my mobile passion is currently only
a hobby. I have yet to actually create any mobile apps, and my hesitation
has been because I despise the Java/Eclipse environment. It just doesn't
mesh well with my way of thinking. The VS/C# approach meshes better with my
brain, and that's why I'm excited for MonoDroid (though admittedly I haven't
had an opportunity to try it out yet). However, once the beta is over, I can
say with confidence I will not pay $400 for a license for something that is
a small hobby. Unless I accidentally create the next Angry Birds, I don't
expect to make much - if any - money from apps I plan to create. I
understand that the $400 license price works well for developers who make a
significant income from this sort of thing, but I simply cannot afford a
$400 license no matter how it's sliced, and I *have* graduated college and
have been in the field for a few years now. A tiered licensing program would
make sense. I would probably pay $100 for it , since my primary app purpose
will be apps for my friends and I which probably won't ever get mass-market
adoption.
