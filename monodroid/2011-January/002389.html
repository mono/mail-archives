2.2 *what*? :-)

There's the 2.2 emulator image, and there's the 2.2 toolchain.  The 2.3 toolchain is the current toolchain, MonoDroid Preview 10 requires the 2.3 toolchain, and...the 2.3 toolchain is SLOW:

Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot we can do.

If you're talking about the emulator image and not the toolchain, that's somewhat expected.  The iPhone simulator is a *simulator*, running compiled x86 code.  The Android emulator is an actual ARM emulator.

Pro: You can take your single ARM-compiled .apk and install it on *both* the emulator *and* hardware.  This isn't possible with the iPhone development environment.

Con: The emulator isn't all that fast.

&gt;<i> Second run of the same app appears quicker, tho I suspect it's inmemory :)
</I>
I've seen this as well.  My guess is disk caching: the first time you launch the .apk it hasn't been loaded into the emulator RAM cache (because the emulator is running a full-blown Android OS, so it has it's own FS cache/etc.).  The second time you run, everything is in cache already, and goes much faster.

However, an followup question is this: how do you exit the app so that you can have a &quot;second run&quot;?

If you just hit the Home button and click your app again, it probably hasn't quit yet and you're actually resuming.

If you hit the Back button, your app &quot;exits&quot; (i.e. Activity.OnDestroy() is invoked), but the Android *process* is still around.  Click your app icon from the Home screen, and Android will reuse the existing process, which is very fast.

If your app crashes, and/or you've 'adb shell'd into the emulator and you `kill` your process (use `ps` to find the process id), then you can be assured that the process has exited.  This is still faster than a cold start, but is slower than Back+app launch.

(Unfortunately the 'kill' approach doesn't work for un-rooted hardware...)

&gt;<i> did I miss something, or is this normal? If I launch a very simple app
</I>&gt;<i> (just the &quot;list sample&quot; on the MD website), I get one &quot;the app is

</I>
Again, normal.  Android has a ~5s timeout before it shows the &quot;this app is taking too long&quot; message, and in the emulator it's not difficult to exceed that timeout (especially during first launch).  Funnily enough, I've seen the same message for Android-included applications (further evidence that the emulator isn't all that fast).  Things tend to behave much better on actual hardware.
