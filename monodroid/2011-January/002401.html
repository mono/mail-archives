<PRE>Hi All,

I've been able to fix my emulator woes on OSX by reinstalling the SDK - all is well and the emulator is pretty fast.

But on Windows, still problems with the performance, reinstall did not help. I did notice however, by launching the emulators side-by-side on OSX and Win7, that the emulator images are quite different. The OSX emulator runs with over 512MB device ram, and there are only 7 running processes. When I launch the emulator on Win7, there are 13 running processes -- but only 96MB of device RAM. I've tried everything I could google, but I just can't get the emulator to launch with more than the default 96MB. 

What I am noticing is that when I terminate a number of those 13 processes, the emulator performance actually increases, as I would expect to happen as resources are freed. So I am beginning to suspect we're not seeing so much a bug in the emulator as (possibly) a configuration issue, but I'm no expert on android memory management.

I played with 2 apps on both systems, the default open GL template activity and the JetBoy sample. After tweaking the emulator, JetBoy ran almost as fast and responsive on Win7 as on OSX, even though I couldn't increase RAM. The OpenGL sample almost doubled it's frame rate.

I did notice a significant difference in the communication between the IDE and the emulator: MonoDevelop on OSX needs only a few seconds to deploy and launch the APK. VS2010 in contrast takes about 3-4 times as long. If anyone needs me to instrument this more precisely, please knock.

Best,
Paul
