<PRE>Excellent, thanks! Guess I won't worry about that bug, then. Sorry if I seemed overly bothered about this...in general, MonoDroid has done a much better job than I expected of adapting an intrinsically Java-oriented environment to C# design principles, and this minor lapse was very disappointing when it seemed to be by design. Thanks for the quick response.

One more question: in general, .NET events are all compatible with EventHandler, the only variation being the actual types of the sender and event args. Is there a technical reason why callback methods like AfterTextChanged accept the same parameters as their corresponding callback methods, rather than an EventArgs class that contains them? It can be useful at times to be able to handle an event without authoring a specific method -- for example, I might have a generic framework that understands the Before*Changed/*Changed/After*Changed pattern and doesn't actually care about any of the parameters of them, but simply wants to perform some processing at the various stages of the event.

It's not really a big deal; I'm just curious what the reasoning is.

That's what we were attempting to do, but due to a copy/paste error we
weren't raising the BeforeTextChanged and TextChanged events unless
AfterTextChanged was attached.  Oops.

It's fixed now and should work properly in the next release.  For now,
the three event attach should be a safe workaround.
