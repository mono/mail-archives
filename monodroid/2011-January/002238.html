<PRE>I hate lawyers....

I'm referring to a C# LGPL library that would be ported to run against
monotouch/monodroid.

I don't think you necessarily need to re-package for the marketplace, I
think you meet 6a if you allow them to re-link your software and put it on
the device.

However, the problem is having the dependency on the Mono-runtime, which
costs money...I think.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, it seems that any library compiled to run on MonoTouch or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>MonoDroid would be dependent on the Mono-runtime,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe?  Again, we need specifics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If the library is a native library which doesn't depend upon Mono at all
</I>&gt;<i>(e.g. libgtk-2.0.so), then MonoDroid isn't really relevant at all: it's
</I>&gt;<i>just another native library, end of discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If the library is a managed library which is portable (e.g. runs on .NET,
</I>&gt;<i>WP7, etc.), then it's not really dependent on Mono per-se, especially
</I>&gt;<i>since everything is dynamically linked via the JIT and not statically
</I>&gt;<i>linked (causing no end of pain/misery for licensing discussions wrt
</I>&gt;<i>Java/etc. -- what's being &quot;linked,&quot; exactly?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>If the library depends upon and requires Mono internals, then it's
</I>&gt;<i>certainly tied to Mono, but the &quot;everything is dynamically linked via the
</I>&gt;<i>JIT&quot; may confuse things enough that it just doesn't matter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I'd rather not lookup how relevant the JIT actually is; my brain already

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My suspicion, backed by sanity but no studies, is that if someone writes

</I>&gt;<i>someone writes a C# LGPL library, they won't care about MonoDroid per-se,
</I>&gt;<i>as long as LGPL &#167;6 can be followed (i.e. relinking is supported), and I
</I>&gt;<i>haven't done enough research to determine an answer to this question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Finally, none of this actually speaks to the &quot;can you do this on the
</I>&gt;<i>Android Marketplace&quot; angle, which requires more expertise than I have.
