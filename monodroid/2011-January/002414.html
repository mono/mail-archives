Are those processes running by default in your emulator?  i don't see them running in my emulator at all.

Subject: Re: [Monodroid] Emulator Slowness


Oops, sorry for the confusion... I didn't stop any processes on windows, rather on the android emulator. I went into the settings and applications, manage applications, and then one by one forced e-mail, messages, music processes and so on to stop. 


Meanwhile, I was able to finally figure out my configuration problems and get an emulator image that had more ram -- but that didn't help a bit! So I am retracting my comments regarding configuration and sticking with the emulator bug theory.


If someone gets in a real bind and is about to miss a deadline, I happen to have a spare HTC Wildfire that I can let someone borrow for a short time, mail me.


Is MonoDevelop on OSX an option for you? There, it's taking about 10-15 seconds (when built) to deploy and launch on the emulator, add on another 10 seconds if the AVD is new and mono runtime deploys beforehand. When I the run open GL template on the emulator, the rectangle gradient rotates smoothly and the background flicker is constant. It's pretty fast, and no, I don't have SSD. JetBoy is just as playable as on the device itself, with the exception of having to operate it via the emulator pad. Performance is roughly comparable to the iOS simulator or the WinPhone one, so I'm not getting why the Win7 version would be several orders of magnitude slower.

procexp.exe has worked well for me.  It can replace task manager and show alot more information and do more than task manager does.

Paul,
 
What processes on Windows did you stop/kill to improve performance?  For me, the emulator is to the point of being unusable so anything would be helpful.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've been able to fix my emulator woes on OSX by reinstalling the SDK - all is well and the emulator is pretty fast.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But on Windows, still problems with the performance, reinstall did not help. I did notice however, by launching the emulators side-by-side on OSX and Win7, that the emulator images are quite different. The OSX emulator runs with over 512MB device ram, and there are only 7 running processes. When I launch the emulator on Win7, there are 13 running processes -- but only 96MB of device RAM. I've tried everything I could google, but I just can't get the emulator to launch with more than the default 96MB. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I am noticing is that when I terminate a number of those 13 processes, the emulator performance actually increases, as I would expect to happen as resources are freed. So I am beginning to suspect we're not seeing so much a bug in the emulator as (possibly) a configuration issue, but I'm no expert on android memory management.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I played with 2 apps on both systems, the default open GL template activity and the JetBoy sample. After tweaking the emulator, JetBoy ran almost as fast and responsive on Win7 as on OSX, even though I couldn't increase RAM. The OpenGL sample almost doubled it's frame rate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I did notice a significant difference in the communication between the IDE and the emulator: MonoDevelop on OSX needs only a few seconds to deploy and launch the APK. VS2010 in contrast takes about 3-4 times as long. If anyone needs me to instrument this more precisely, please knock.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Paul
