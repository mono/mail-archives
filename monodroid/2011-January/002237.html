And thus increases the confusion.  Specifics are necessary.

For example, are we talking a native LGPL library?  If so, that's ~trivial: replace the $APPDIR/lib/libfoo.so that's present on your device, and you &quot;relinked&quot; your libraries.  (Aren't shared libraries fun?)

However, if we're talking a C# LGPL library, then...I don't know.  Assemblies are stored (uncompressed) within the .apk, and thus to &quot;relink&quot; the C# library you'd have to recreate the .apk file.  I don't know how easy this would be to do (perhaps you could just extract the .apk, update the .apk [it's only a .zip file], then reinstall the .apk?).  This is only tangentially related to MonoDroid (MonoDroid is only involved because it's the one stuffing things into the .apk); it's up to the app author to determine whether they're in compliance with the LGPL, whether above parenthesized workaround actually works and &quot;supports&quot; the spirit of the LGPL, etc.

&gt;<i> However, it seems that any library compiled to run on MonoTouch or MonoDroid would be dependent on the Mono-runtime,
</I>
Maybe?  Again, we need specifics.

If the library is a native library which doesn't depend upon Mono at all (e.g. libgtk-2.0.so), then MonoDroid isn't really relevant at all: it's just another native library, end of discussion.

If the library is a managed library which is portable (e.g. runs on .NET, WP7, etc.), then it's not really dependent on Mono per-se, especially since everything is dynamically linked via the JIT and not statically linked (causing no end of pain/misery for licensing discussions wrt Java/etc. -- what's being &quot;linked,&quot; exactly?).

If the library depends upon and requires Mono internals, then it's certainly tied to Mono, but the &quot;everything is dynamically linked via the JIT&quot; may confuse things enough that it just doesn't matter.

I'd rather not lookup how relevant the JIT actually is; my brain already hurts.

My suspicion, backed by sanity but no studies, is that if someone writes a C# library they don't really care what runtime it's executed under (.NET, Mono, Portable.NET, Grasshopper...), and thus the fact that MonoDroid is the execution environment really doesn't matter.  Thus, if someone writes a C# LGPL library, they won't care about MonoDroid per-se, as long as LGPL &#167;6 can be followed (i.e. relinking is supported), and I haven't done enough research to determine an answer to this question.

Finally, none of this actually speaks to the &quot;can you do this on the Android Marketplace&quot; angle, which requires more expertise than I have.
