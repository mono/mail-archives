I'm not a lawyer.  Nor did sleep at a Holiday Inn Express last night [0].  (Does that joke still work?)

That said, I think there are two of ways for your question to be phrased, which may elicit different answers: &quot;random&quot; LGPL libraries which have no relation to MonoDroid (short answer: yes), and LGPL libraries which require MonoDroid (short answer: maybe).

For &quot;random&quot; libraries, I don't believe that MonoDroid changes anything since MonoDroid won't be directly referencing whatever LGPL library you're considering, and thus I don't believe that any part of the LGPL applies to MonoDroid; it would instead apply to the resulting application, and the presence of MonoDroid should be ignorable (unless you want the resulting application to be GPL'd, then see [1]).

For LGPL libraries which require MonoDroid, I believe that this, historically, looks like the non-GPL Qt use situation.  The answer is that this can work, but the copyright owner of the LGPL library needs to explicitly exempt MonoDroid from the LGPL[1].

That said, realistically MonoDroid isn't the controlling factor here.  Instead, the Android Marketplace is the controlling factor, as the LGPL covers distribution, not use, and it's the Android Marketplace which is actually distributing the app (normally; you could distribute yourself, of course, but let's go for the common case).  I don't see the Android Marketplace as being significantly different from the Apple App Store (again, I'm not a lawyer), and the FSF appears to believe that GPL apps can't be placed on the Apple App Store because Apple imposes additional restrictions on apps [2]).

Unfortunately, I can't find a very clear &quot;yay or nay&quot; on whether GPL apps can be distributed on the Android Marketplace by others than the copyright holder.
