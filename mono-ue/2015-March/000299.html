<PRE>As mentioned - we have tens of thousands of lines of C#, and a small number
of lines in JavaScript.  In short:


   - We have developers that need to know one language - C#
   - The rest of our product is in a single language
   - C++ itself is notoriously painful (though I know it reasonably well
   myself - I find it far easier to code in C# with Linq, reflection,
   automatic GC, etc etc)

In short: rather than either re-skill a developer to C++, or fragment the
team, or outsource the work, or any one of a myriad issues surrounding
supporting C++ - we're using C# unless a compelling case can be made to
support multiple languages.  As it is we're using C# with a number of
additional frameworks (eg Postsharp, etc) - so it's a non-trivial C#
environment in any case.

This should be just a plugin - built by Xamarin or Unreal / Epic.  This
would install in seconds. Ryan Burnham's comment seems to indicate the
issues he's found using the existing practice of &quot;compile your own&quot;.

In addition to the rebuild problem - the statements around the fact that
the plugin isn't &quot;production ready&quot; after many months of apparently zero
development does not fill me with any sense that it's a viable option
long-term, and could be killed at any point.

Epic / Unreal - if you're listening : I will be blogging about our
experiences with the C# environment.   My most honest and best advice is
this:


   - Finish it - not all features need to be supported, but core ones do
   need to be
   - Include C# / Mono as part of your software build process - which will
   make it part of your normal dev cycle, and will disappear as a problem
   - Distribute it with the product out of the box
   - Trumpet it across the C# development threads

Right now it's a failed feature launch.  It indicates that it's easy to use
- but the reality is far from this, and is largely full of frustration.

</I>&gt;<i> I think my request still stands.  There is very little (if any) benefit to
</I>&gt;<i> having each individual developer compiling on their own.  Few (if any)
</I>&gt;<i> Unreal downloadable examples appear to use 4.4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am re-tasking our developers to Unity as of this morning, and halting
</I>&gt;<i> Unreal development entirely.   We may return to Unreal at some point, but
</I>&gt;<i> will review the decision to support two engines in detail before committing
</I>&gt;<i> to that effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If there are someone within Xamarin / Unreal that this email can be
</I>&gt;<i> forwarded to - I'd appreciate it.  We're expending effort developing
</I>&gt;<i> products, not wasting time recompiling (with compilation errors, as it
</I>&gt;<i> turns out) non-production grade toolchains.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm somewhat confused as to why each developer wishing to use C# &quot;must&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> recompile from source.  As far as I can see there's nothing compelling
</I>&gt;<i> within the Mono code that requires that each developer should rebuild for
</I>&gt;<i> their own specific machine or environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can I suggest that the better (best) approach be that a virtualised build
</I>&gt;<i> environment be established within Xamarin or Unreal / Epic, and that a
</I>&gt;<i> single developer be tasked with updating the Mono plugin on each release of
</I>&gt;<i> the game engine (presumably the API's don't change between patches to point
</I>&gt;<i> releases - eg 4.7 + patch will be compatible with the plugin if 4.7 raw is
</I>&gt;<i> compatible.  This developer wouldn't be full time, but may perhaps spend a
</I>&gt;<i> day each month (or less, assuming straightforward compatibility between
</I>&gt;<i> releases).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this stage there is potentially a vast amount of wasted effort having
</I>&gt;<i> every C# developer establishing a full Mono build environment and toolchain
</I>&gt;<i> for C#, when in fact most developers (including myself) simply want to
</I>&gt;<i> download the Mono plugin and add it to the UDK, then add our own C#
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We currently have one developer spending several days simply getting a
</I>&gt;<i> Mono C# plugin environment to run, when in reality a pre-built Mono plugin
</I>&gt;<i> would have removed all of that needless effort, and reduced the time to
</I>&gt;<i> hours at most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would prefer to use Unreal rather than Unity, however at this stage I
</I>&gt;<i> may pull our Unreal development completely and switch our (early phase)
</I>&gt;<i> project to the Unity platform based solely on the lack of a simplified
</I>&gt;<i> development toolchain with C# / Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that all the other code for our project (20 + C## projects, tens of
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of lines of code) are C#, and I see no reason to add a small
</I>&gt;<i> amount of C++ purely to support Unreal, and based solely on the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> recompiling the Mono C# plugin for each UDK release is non-core effort.
