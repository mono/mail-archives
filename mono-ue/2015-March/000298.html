<PRE>Ryan - do you have builds of Mono / C# for the latest version of UDK (4.7)
?  - Are these something you'd be able to share if you do?  We can host the
DLL's if you'd like - but the should also be able to be added to the Unreal
Git repo or similar.

</I>&gt;<i> The plugin isn't complete and not ready for production use, not to mention

</I>&gt;<i> not everyone is required to build UE4/plugin from scratch. Once it is

</I>&gt;<i> I'm somewhat confused as to why each developer wishing to use C# &quot;must&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> within the Mono code that requires that each developer should rebuild for
</I>&gt;<i> their own specific machine or environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can I suggest that the better (best) approach be that a virtualised build
</I>&gt;<i> environment be established within Xamarin or Unreal / Epic, and that a
</I>&gt;<i> single developer be tasked with updating the Mono plugin on each release of
</I>&gt;<i> the game engine (presumably the API's don't change between patches to point
</I>&gt;<i> releases - eg 4.7 + patch will be compatible with the plugin if 4.7 raw is
</I>&gt;<i> compatible.  This developer wouldn't be full time, but may perhaps spend a
</I>&gt;<i> day each month (or less, assuming straightforward compatibility between
</I>&gt;<i> releases).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this stage there is potentially a vast amount of wasted effort having
</I>&gt;<i> every C# developer establishing a full Mono build environment and toolchain
</I>&gt;<i> for C#, when in fact most developers (including myself) simply want to
</I>&gt;<i> download the Mono plugin and add it to the UDK, then add our own C#
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We currently have one developer spending several days simply getting a
</I>&gt;<i> Mono C# plugin environment to run, when in reality a pre-built Mono plugin
</I>&gt;<i> would have removed all of that needless effort, and reduced the time to
</I>&gt;<i> hours at most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would prefer to use Unreal rather than Unity, however at this stage I
</I>&gt;<i> may pull our Unreal development completely and switch our (early phase)
</I>&gt;<i> project to the Unity platform based solely on the lack of a simplified
</I>&gt;<i> development toolchain with C# / Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that all the other code for our project (20 + C## projects, tens of
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of lines of code) are C#, and I see no reason to add a small
</I>&gt;<i> amount of C++ purely to support Unreal, and based solely on the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> recompiling the Mono C# plugin for each UDK release is non-core effort.
