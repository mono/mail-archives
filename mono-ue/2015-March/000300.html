<PRE>Disclaimer: I speak for neither Epic nor Xamarin, but the info here is all
readily available if you look.

Epic is not really involved in this. This is a Xamarin operation and an
as-yet exploratory one. If your production needs hinge on there being C#
support, I think you will need to look elsewhere for the time being.

That said, there are a few things you might consider:
1) Your desire for binary releases for every is understandable, but for
larger teams/organizations it is immensely helpful to have the tools build
as just part of your normal process. Especially when it comes time to prep
to go live, you want the ability to lock down a version but still take bug
fixes from downstream (not to mention any changes you may want to make to
better support your usage). If building the tools and distributing them to
your team (via source control like Perforce or a local CDN... don't use
DVCS like git or hg for large binary content) is just part of your normal
process, then it won't be a potentially crippling distraction in the
critical time of your project.
2) There are things C# does not do well, especially in realtime
applications (though I don't think you've specified, this doesn't sound
like a &quot;game&quot; project, but this still applies in general for RTA). C/C++ is
difficult to avoid at a certain level, since some of the hoops you have to
go through to get the same behavior in C# (say, fixed structured arrays);
not to mention, the runtime optimizers are still less than ideal
(especially the Mono-Unity version. Holy hell, it's terrible). It's hard to
say whether it would come to that since I don't really know your project,
but I quite often find a moment where I really want to be explicit about
what the computer should do and C# is not the language for that (arguably,
neither is C++).
I still like C#, and I am watching this project closely, but I don't think
you are going to get what you want here.

-Robert

PS: not sure what build issues you are having, but I found the process
pretty straight forward if you follow the directions. A few things though:
1) Make sure you have all of the prereqs (don't skip things like the DX
Runtime version it specfies... it can give you seemingly unrelated build
errors) installed and ready.
2) Build the vanilla version of UE4 first just to ensure that is correct.
It's a mostly turn key process, so other than build time (do it in the
background), it's not much of a hassle.
3) Start with 4.4, since that's the version that it is targeting while the
plugin stabilizes. You can get it working with the later versions, but I
would hold off on that until you get it working with 4.4 (easier to get
support).

</I>&gt;<i> In short: rather than either re-skill a developer to C++, or fragment the
</I>&gt;<i> team, or outsource the work, or any one of a myriad issues surrounding
</I>&gt;<i> supporting C++ - we're using C# unless a compelling case can be made to
</I>&gt;<i> support multiple languages.  As it is we're using C# with a number of
</I>&gt;<i> additional frameworks (eg Postsharp, etc) - so it's a non-trivial C#
</I>&gt;<i> environment in any case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This should be just a plugin - built by Xamarin or Unreal / Epic.  This
</I>&gt;<i> would install in seconds. Ryan Burnham's comment seems to indicate the
</I>&gt;<i> issues he's found using the existing practice of &quot;compile your own&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to the rebuild problem - the statements around the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> the plugin isn't &quot;production ready&quot; after many months of apparently zero
</I>&gt;<i> development does not fill me with any sense that it's a viable option
</I>&gt;<i> long-term, and could be killed at any point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Epic / Unreal - if you're listening : I will be blogging about our
</I>&gt;<i> experiences with the C# environment.   My most honest and best advice is
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Finish it - not all features need to be supported, but core ones do
</I>&gt;<i>    need to be
</I>&gt;<i>    - Include C# / Mono as part of your software build process - which
</I>&gt;<i>    will make it part of your normal dev cycle, and will disappear as a problem
</I>&gt;<i>    - Distribute it with the product out of the box
</I>&gt;<i>    - Trumpet it across the C# development threads
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now it's a failed feature launch.  It indicates that it's easy to
</I>&gt;<i> use - but the reality is far from this, and is largely full of frustration.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think my request still stands.  There is very little (if any) benefit

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We currently have one developer spending several days simply getting a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that all the other code for our project (20 + C## projects, tens of
