<PRE>The plugin isn't complete and not ready for production use, not to mention
the plugin requires changes with UE4 itself (thus the patches). However,
not everyone is required to build UE4/plugin from scratch. Once it is
built, you should be able to redistribute it to your other developers and
only have them setup with C# related tools like Xamarin Studio and it's
plugin.

</I>&gt;<i> their own specific machine or environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can I suggest that the better (best) approach be that a virtualised build
</I>&gt;<i> environment be established within Xamarin or Unreal / Epic, and that a
</I>&gt;<i> single developer be tasked with updating the Mono plugin on each release of
</I>&gt;<i> the game engine (presumably the API's don't change between patches to point
</I>&gt;<i> releases - eg 4.7 + patch will be compatible with the plugin if 4.7 raw is
</I>&gt;<i> compatible.  This developer wouldn't be full time, but may perhaps spend a
</I>&gt;<i> day each month (or less, assuming straightforward compatibility between
</I>&gt;<i> releases).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this stage there is potentially a vast amount of wasted effort having
</I>&gt;<i> every C# developer establishing a full Mono build environment and toolchain
</I>&gt;<i> for C#, when in fact most developers (including myself) simply want to
</I>&gt;<i> download the Mono plugin and add it to the UDK, then add our own C#
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We currently have one developer spending several days simply getting a
</I>&gt;<i> Mono C# plugin environment to run, when in reality a pre-built Mono plugin
</I>&gt;<i> would have removed all of that needless effort, and reduced the time to
</I>&gt;<i> hours at most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would prefer to use Unreal rather than Unity, however at this stage I
</I>&gt;<i> may pull our Unreal development completely and switch our (early phase)
</I>&gt;<i> project to the Unity platform based solely on the lack of a simplified
</I>&gt;<i> development toolchain with C# / Mono.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that all the other code for our project (20 + C## projects, tens of
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of lines of code) are C#, and I see no reason to add a small
</I>&gt;<i> amount of C++ purely to support Unreal, and based solely on the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> recompiling the Mono C# plugin for each UDK release is non-core effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
