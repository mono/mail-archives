<PRE>Hi, I'm not too familiar with how this whole system works, so if I should
be asking this somewhere else I'd appreciate some direction.

I've spent several hours trying to get Mono running with UE4 to no avail.
I've done everything up to Adding Mono for Unreal Engine according to plan,
at least I think I have.  I'm currently stuck on steps 3/4 of the above
section.

I have several HDD's in my PC and I didn't want my repos on my C drive, so
the directory to my G drive.  Being relatively new to using the git bash it
took me a little while to actually get things working the way I wanted, but
I ended up using the command
&quot;cd G:\UnrealEngine\Engine\Plugins\XamarinUE4\Patches&quot;  and then simply &quot;git
am&quot; from there. My reasoning for this was that the command &quot;git am
G:\....\Patches\*&quot; was giving me a &quot;directory not found&quot; error. I ran my
'git am' command and the cursor just sat there flashing for awhile, so I
closed and reopened the bash and did the same command in the same location,
but it said a duplicate was found. This led me to believe I had
successfully completed that part of the instructions. After this I decided
to build the solution in VS the same way I did prior to putting in the Mono
code, but now I'm getting 3 errors:

1. Superclass DefaultTemplateProjectDefs of class MonoTemplateProjectDefs
not found
2. error code: 2
3. error MSB3073: The command &quot;......Build.bat UE4Editor Win64 Development&quot;
exited with code -1.

Any help I could get with this?

Thank you,
Nick
