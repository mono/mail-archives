<PRE>Hi Michael,
I've had a chance to play around with removing the Project Types from the csproj file. While this does allow me to open the project in visual studio I have noticed a couple of things that do not work properly

1. The generated input helper class in obj\Debug\MonoUE4\helpers\InputIniHelpers.g.cs is no longer included in the project. It does however get included when you build. This means using an action like InputAction.Jump appears as an error but the build still passes so it's not a huge issue.
2. Hot Reloading stops working. This would have to be the biggest killer. But I did some testing and as soon as I remove the ProjectType guids hot reloading stops working. 

Guess I'm stuck with XS for now. It does the job but it's not quite the same experience. 

Regards
Ryan

No plans for a VS extension at the moment, though we could do it in future if there's sufficient interest. We targeted XS first since it's easier to write XS addins and we also wanted to support Mac.

XS does have a number of ReSharper's features though they're not all enabled out of the box, e.g. source analysis. My Evolve talk
(<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQWdRQTrHTQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQWdRQTrHTQ</A>) covers some of this.

You could also just remove the flavor GUIDs from the csproj files and you'll be able to open them in VS. You won't have any UnrealEd integration but editing and compilation should work.
