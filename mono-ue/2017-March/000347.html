<PRE>Hey,

as far as I know. Every repository that is forked from <A HREF="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine">https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine</A>
also becomes a private repository that is accessible only to people having acces to the upstream.

This is what Łukasz was referring to. See for example how Nvidia shares their GameWorks changes:
<A HREF="https://github.com/NvPhysX/UnrealEngine">https://github.com/NvPhysX/UnrealEngine</A>

This is what the EULA is saying:

&gt;<i> Any public Distribution (i.e., intended for Engine Licensees generally) which includes Engine Tools (including as modified by you under the License) must take place either through the Marketplace (e.g., for distributing a Product’s modding tool or editor to end users) or through a fork of Epic’s GitHub UnrealEngine Network (e.g., for distributing source code).
</I>
So it seems, that creating a for of Epic's repo and putting the changes there is a way to go and it
wouldn't require any eligibility checks on your side. GitHub does that for you.
