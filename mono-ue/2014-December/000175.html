<PRE>We've mainly been focused on the &quot;Editor&quot; build, the &quot;Client&quot;/&quot;Server&quot;
targets are not something we've tested. However, if you stage a &quot;Game&quot;
build that should work.

When debugging from Xamarin Studio, we actually instruct the editor to
start a new standalone process and connect the debugger to that, so it
shoudn't be affected by existing editor state. The log output of that
gets written to a log file and XS tries to read that into the
&quot;Application Output&quot; pad - do you see any errors there?

Sorry about Ludum Dare :/
