Gecko/20100404 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.3

No videos on <A HREF="http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/">http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/</A> works.
The application loads, but the video doesn't.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. When on a page with a video and Windows VM is loaded, click &quot;innstillinger&quot;
near the top right corner.
2. Select &quot;Windows Silverlight&quot;
3. Press &quot;Godkjenn innstillinger&quot;
Actual Results:  
The &quot;Silverlight/Moonloght&quot; application loaded, but the video didn't.

Expected Results:  
That both the application and the video would load.

&lt;VoJe&gt; Hello! I am having some problems with moonlight... The player starts ok,
but it doesn't start to load the file.. It just stands there looking silly...
&lt;spouliot&gt; jeffra45: yep - but a [SecurityCritical] FormatMyHardDrive would not
be a &quot;secure code base&quot; but perfectly valid and safe if it can't be reached
&lt;-- eno har avsluttet (Leaving...)
&lt;spouliot&gt; VoJe: not much we can do without your browser (name/version),
moonlight plugin version, URL of the application, distro and arch...
&lt;jeffra45&gt; spouliot: Hmm alright I think that makes sense to me, thanks for
your help
&lt;VoJe&gt; Ok. i have experienced this problem on all the different distros i have
tried and all the browsers, so maybe it is the URL.. Or i could be that i have
64-bit.
 The URL of the application is www.nrk.no
 or, the application is deeper inside the web page, shall i find a link?
&lt;spouliot&gt; if you car breaks down and you call for help will you them tell
where you are ? or let them guess ? ;-)
&lt;VoJe&gt; <A HREF="http://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/klipp/625996/">http://www.nrk.no/nett-tv/klipp/625996/</A> this one f.ex. But, you have to
go to &quot;innstillinger&quot; near the top right corner, choose &quot;Windows Silverlight&quot;
ant press &quot;Lagre innstillinger&quot;.
 I haven't managed to watch any videos on this web page under any
linux-installation i've had using moonlight. But it works like a charm in
windows.
&lt;spouliot&gt; nothing happens when I click on &quot;innstillinger&quot;
&lt;VoJe&gt; ?
 hmmm
 there should slide down some settings
&lt;spouliot&gt; I suspect NRK, like most commercial TV, is using DRM - at least
googling seems to suggest this
 rolf: you know anything about nrk.no ?
&lt;VoJe&gt; It's the national broadcaster in Norway.
 but would using DRM explain why it doesn't work in linux?
&lt;spouliot&gt; yes it would, see /topic
&lt;VoJe&gt; ahhh
 But it recommends moonlight for Linux and Mac users, and that would be strange
if moonlight couldn't handle their content, wouldn't it?
&lt;spouliot&gt; that's the standard web page / message for Silverlight - it
(generally) does not come from the application (like nrk.no)
&lt;VoJe&gt; hmm, but in their help section they explain in detail, in Norwegian,
so...
 but is there any way to find out if they use DRM?
&lt;spouliot&gt; I can see the app but no video from Canada - there's likely some geo
restrictions too
&lt;VoJe&gt; It says that there is geo restrictions on some files, try clicking some
of the other links then
--&gt; Ismael (~<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/moonlight-bugs">Ismael at 80.30.44.213</A>) har blitt med i #moonlight
&lt;VoJe&gt; But anyway, that is the problem i am having as well, i see the app, but
no video
&lt;spouliot&gt; open a terminal window and start your browser like this:
 MOON_TRACE=N:x MOONLIGHT_ENABLE_CONSOLE=1 firefox
 and make sure you don't have an instance of FF already running
&lt;VoJe&gt; does it work using chronium as well?
&lt;spouliot&gt; the paste the content on monobin.com
 yes it should - it's moonlight, not browser, specific
&lt;VoJe&gt; ok, so just load the page with the video, then post the whole content of
what the konsole says?
&lt;spouliot&gt; yep
&lt;VoJe&gt; <A HREF="http://monobin.com/__d3bcdbee9">http://monobin.com/__d3bcdbee9</A>
 done
 I think this is more representativ, got my firefox working again now, and that
is what i am usually using.. <A HREF="http://monobin.com/__d5ebd6008">http://monobin.com/__d5ebd6008</A>
 here the error was different
 seemingly
&lt;miguel_&gt; tasty cairo and pixman update
&lt;spouliot&gt; VoJe: did you put MOON_TRACE=N:x on your FF try ?
&lt;spouliot&gt; nm, I see it in the logs
&lt;VoJe&gt; :)
 But, yes i did
&lt;spouliot&gt; well the logs show nothing :( but I was able (just by waiting very
long it seems) to get something out of &quot;innstillinger&quot;
 I can select Silverlight and get the application - but it stops at the same
place as my Windows VM did, likely because of geo-restriction
&lt;VoJe&gt; hmm, but i experience the same problem with linux, it just stops.
 And they say they have geo-restriction, but only on live-streams and some
shows..
 so it should work
 could it be that they are using a newer version of silverlight that moonlight
can't handle?
 hmmm, but that doesn't explain why Windows VM stops aswell
&lt;spouliot&gt; it's possible but since we're not seeing any exception of the
console... I doubt it
&lt;VoJe&gt; ok
--&gt; mib_gjwwdm (<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/moonlight-bugs">c1068827 at widget.mibbit.com</A>) har blitt med i #moonlight
&lt;VoJe&gt; but i doubt that it doesn't work for you because of geo-restrictions, i
bet it's the same bug i am experiencing..
&lt;-- mib_gjwwdm har avsluttet (<A HREF="http://www.mibbit.com">http://www.mibbit.com</A> ajax IRC Client)
&lt;spouliot&gt; well I do get the same result under Windows/SL4
&lt;VoJe&gt; oh?
 hmm
 then it's probably geo...
&lt;spouliot&gt; something may be wrong on their web site - but then you would not be
able to get content from Windows too
&lt;VoJe&gt; stupid.
 that's my conclusion aswell
 but from my logs everything seems ok?
&lt;spouliot&gt; better news, your link (above) works for me on Windows (but not the
one I selected previously)
&lt;VoJe&gt; ahh
then some shows have geo-restrictions
 not all
