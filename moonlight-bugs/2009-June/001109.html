File a bug about this so that we don't forget about it.

&lt;rolf&gt; toshok: calling Debugger.Break crashes the process, and fixing it
requires runtime changes (since the method is inlined directly by the jit)
&lt;rolf&gt; it raises a sigint, which ends up bringing down the process
&lt;toshok&gt; ew
&lt;rolf&gt; do we care to fix it? (can't see it as a security issue)
&lt;toshok&gt; shouldn't it be ignored if we're not running in a debugger?
&lt;toshok&gt; are we calling it someplacec?
&lt;toshok&gt; or is it a test?
&lt;rolf&gt; toshok: 5003 is crashing because of it (an unexpected exception, and it
seems like MS left a Debugger.Break while debugging in the code)
&lt;toshok&gt; having Debugger.Break bring down a process seems really bad
&lt;rolf&gt; yeah, but fixing it either requires moonlight to tell the jit what to do
about Debugger.Break, or a #if MOONLIGHT in the runtime code
&lt;toshok&gt; is there some mono_* call to do the former?
&lt;rolf&gt; toshok: looking at the source code I couldn't find any
&lt;rolf&gt; method-to-ir.c:~3993
&lt;toshok&gt; rolf: ugh
&lt;toshok&gt; lupus: ping?
&lt;lupus&gt; toshok: hey
&lt;lupus&gt; are you sure you don't have some other bug that triggers the
Debugger.Break?
&lt;lupus&gt; that call is supposed to do what it does in mono currently
&lt;toshok&gt; oh we most certainly do.  an unhandled exception makes it to a handler
in the test
&lt;toshok&gt; but in the 2.1 case it's bad to exit the process
&lt;toshok&gt; since a plugin brings down the entire browser :(
&lt;lupus&gt; sure, what I want to understand is: is this a moonlight bug and you
want us to introduce a workaround in mono to cover for it?
&lt;lupus&gt; I guess normal code in SL shouldn't e able to call Break()
&lt;rolf&gt; it is
&lt;rolf&gt; allowed
&lt;lupus&gt; so what happens in SL apps on reak()?
&lt;rolf&gt; the thing is that on Windows it does not bring down the process, it pops
up a dialog
&lt;lupus&gt; Break() that is
&lt;rolf&gt; asking you to attach a debugger
&lt;lupus&gt; yes, that is because windows (the operating system) triggers the dialog
on a breakpoint
&lt;rolf&gt; (note that it's Windows popping up the dialog, not SL, nor managed code)
&lt;lupus&gt; I guess that is configurable
&lt;lupus&gt; so why should mono behave differently than the MS runtime?
&lt;toshok&gt; can't you choose to ignore the break on windows?
&lt;toshok&gt; i thought you could
&lt;rolf&gt; you have a &quot;Continue&quot; button on the dialog
&lt;toshok&gt; but regardless, there's at least some indication of what is going on
&lt;lupus&gt; you can on linux, too, just run the thing under gdb:)
&lt;toshok&gt; the mono code assumes a debugger is attached, otherwise the process
exits
&lt;toshok&gt; Debugger.Break = &quot;the app crashed&quot; in bugzilla
&lt;lupus&gt; I guess if you hit Continue the process dies
&lt;rolf&gt; nope, it ignores the breakpoint
&lt;kangaroo&gt; question
&lt;kangaroo&gt; it raises a sigint right?
&lt;lupus&gt; I suggest overwriting the break opcode with a nop opcode in the binary,
it's less hackish than what you're asking, imho
&lt;toshok&gt; ...
&lt;toshok&gt; seriously?  less hackish? :)
&lt;kangaroo&gt; rolf: ? this becomes a sigint right?
&lt;rolf&gt; kangaroo: yes
&lt;kangaroo&gt; why dont we just add sigint handler to the signal chaining
&lt;kangaroo&gt; and then moonlight can handle the signal internally
&lt;rolf&gt; right, but what happens then if you ctrl-c in gdb?
&lt;toshok&gt; sigint = ctrl-c
&lt;lewing&gt; or on the console
&lt;kangaroo&gt; dont do that? :)
&lt;toshok&gt; you can't ignore it and preserve functionality
&lt;kangaroo&gt; nod
&lt;lupus&gt; toshok: asking mono to do something different than the MS runtime is
more hackish and involves aevery user of mono, instead fixing one incorrect
binary is the sane thing to do
&lt;toshok&gt; it's not doing something different
&lt;toshok&gt; right now we're doing something different
&lt;toshok&gt; if anything i'm asking to unify the two approaches
&lt;toshok&gt; and the binary isn't incorrect
&lt;rolf&gt; imho this would work if we built a different mono binary for moonlight
&lt;toshok&gt; the behavior on mono is incorrect
&lt;rolf&gt; and we could #if MOONLIGHT
&lt;lupus&gt; you'd have to catch the sigabort, but you shouldn't do that, sigabort
is considered reseved by the mono runtie
&lt;rolf&gt; out the Debugger.Break code in the jit
&lt;toshok&gt; why not just check if we have a debugger attached, and if so, emit a
SIGINT.  otherwise do nothing?
&lt;lupus&gt; toshok: if you run moonlight on windows, the current mono would behave
the same as the MS runtime
&lt;toshok&gt; that gets us closer to the windows dialog, without the dialog
&lt;toshok&gt; lupus: get back to me when we can run moonlight on windows
&lt;lupus&gt; so you want mono to do something different than SL
&lt;toshok&gt; no, i want mono to approximate the windows behavior when run on linux
&lt;rolf&gt; well, bringing down the process is already something different
&lt;lupus&gt; toshok: sure, I'm just saying that you're wron about mono doing now the
different/wrong thing
&lt;toshok&gt; seriously, exiting a process unconditionally on a Debugger.Break call
is seriously broken.  you must see this.
&lt;lupus&gt; it's not mono that brings down the process
&lt;rolf&gt; of course not, it's linux' &quot;bad&quot; handling of sigint, but it doesn't make
a difference to the user
&lt;toshok&gt; mono is the one emitting the sigint, so i call bullshit :)
&lt;toshok&gt; right
&lt;lupus&gt; so, does SL allow a Break on any SL app? it should be a DOS of sorts
for the user
&lt;lupus&gt; can anyone try that?
&lt;lupus&gt; it would be pretty stupid of them to allow it for untrusted apps
&lt;lupus&gt; toshok: the app is asking mono to do it
* rolf tries
&lt;lewing&gt; there are no trusted apps ;)
&lt;miguel_&gt; I can try that
&lt;miguel_&gt; OK, rolf is on the case ;-)
&lt;miguel_&gt; Never mind
&lt;toshok&gt; lupus: the app is asking to break in a debugger.  not exit
&lt;toshok&gt; i'm saying there needs to be something in the runtime to distinguish
those two events, otherwise we lose completely.
&lt;rolf&gt; what's the problem with #if MOONLIGHT?
&lt;toshok&gt; i wouldn't have a problem with that - we're already building a custom
mono/etc
&lt;rolf&gt; assuming that we build a different mono for moonlight
&lt;toshok&gt; but imo it really should be in the runtime for all instances
&lt;rolf&gt; actually on SL nothing happens unless you're attached to a debugger
&lt;rolf&gt; in which case it works just like a break point
&lt;toshok&gt; rolf: cool, so identical to &quot;check ptrace, emit sigint if there's a
debugger, do nothing otherwise&quot;
&lt;lupus&gt; ok, so in SL it behaves differently than the usual runtime
&lt;rolf&gt; toshok: yes
&lt;lewing&gt; might be nice to control at the embedding api level really
&lt;toshok&gt; huh, yeah, interesting.  and wholely desirable - if you run firefox
outside of the vs debugging environment, debugger.break does nothing
&lt;toshok&gt; even if vs is also running
