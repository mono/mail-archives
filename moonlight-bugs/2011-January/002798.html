           Summary: Tab key not working properly with DataGrid (both

Test Case A (SLProto37A - Simple Telerik)

User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10
(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.237 Safari/534.10

My app has a Telerik datagrid with 3 columns. The 1st and the 3rd are readonly.
Only the 2nd is editable. 

The bug's scenario happens when editing a cell of the 2nd column (the only one
you can edit in the first place). If you press the TAB key in SL, it will
continue editing the cell immediately bellow. This allows for a nice
user-experience when editing several cells in the same column. In ML, instead
of moving the focus to and editing the cell below, it moves the focus to the
cell on to the left (the cell on the same row, on the 3rd column), and stops to
edit.

I am attaching 3 test-cases, all representing the same problem, but with slight
variations.

In the first test-case, SLProto37A, I am using the Telerik RadGridView with
very simple columns. This is the most simple test case of the three.

In the second test-case, SLProto37B, I am using Microsoft's DataGrid. I believe
that because it displays the same problem as Teleriks, this isn't a Telerik
specific problem.

The third test-case, SLProto37C, is pretty much like SLProto37A, only the
second column (the editable one) has its own datatemplate and I am handling a
few events to make the user's life even easier. In ML, even though I can edit
several cells of column 2 by just pressing TAB, focus is still passing by cells
1 and 3, which shouldn't happen, leading the user to have to press several TABs
instead of just one to move to the cell below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run TestPage.html from SLProto37A in ML
2. Double click the 2nd column of the first row and type a number.
3. Press TAB and notice that the focus doesn't move to the cell below and that
it doesn't begin to edit that cell. Instead, it moves the focus to the cell on
the right.
4. Try out in Silverlight to checkout the difference.
Actual Results:  
TAB key not jumping only through cells of the editable column.

Expected Results:  
TAB key jumping only through cells of the editable column and having each cell
edited as focus is moving.

While I was writing this, I spotted another difference in behaviour between SL
and ML when running each of the 3 test-cases. In SL, you will see the 3rd
column's values being updated as you edit the 2nd column. For some reason, in
ML this is failing and no matter what value you put on the second column, 3rd
column just stays with zero. The 3rd column is bound to a calculated property
that returns the product of properties the 1st and 2nd columns are bound to.
