--- Comment #5 from Rick Masters &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/moonlight-bugs">rmasters at nwlink.com</A>&gt;  2008-08-21 12:10:19 MDT ---
Thank you for the prompt attention to this bug report and for your work on
Moonlight. 

I have also confirmed that the page does not crash on Fedora 9. (However, there
is a serious new issue with Canvas.ZIndex being ignored for non Canvas
elements, but I'll take the time to verify it exists on Suse before I create a
report this time. And I found a good workaround so its not urgent)

I have also confirmed that the page will crash Fedora 8 predictably. You can
download a Fedora 8 VM image from thoughtpolice.co.uk, fire it up, click
through the config screens, point firefox (comes with 2.0.0.8) at the page and
it crashes. (It also crashes after getting the latest fedora 8 updates).This
was using a Dell Windows XP box as a VM host to eliminate any commonalities
with my regular fedora 8 hardware.

When you update one thing and that one thing now fails, my first inclination is
to blame the update. I have to admit I thought this was a clear boo-boo in
Moonlight .8, but it is more likely that ML .8 just tickles some existing
problem in fedora 8 that has already been fixed. Sorry about that. So, the
question is, figure out a workaround for fedora 8 or move on? I'm inclined to
move on. I do not have a moonlight dev environment, and am not motivated to try
to set one up for Fedora 8. Of course, if you guys want to investigate just to
be highly vigilant about confirming the problem was actually resolved and not
hidden by another change, that would be great, but it is not expected.

I am OK with this bug being closed. I had thought fedora 8 was a fairly common
distro but I guess I'm a little out of date. And heck, this part of the market
is so small anyway that requiring linux customers to have the latest distro
upgrade does not bother me much. And I'll switch to Suse or Ubuntu to keep on
the same page with you guys from now on...
Thanks
